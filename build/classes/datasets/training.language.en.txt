is the name given to the religious which purports to contain a record made by one clement whom the narrative identifies as both and s cousin of discourses involving the together with an account of the circumstances under which clement came to be peter s travelling companion and of other details of clement s family history overview this has come down to us in two forms one form is called the clementine homilies which consists of 20 books and exists in the original the other is called the clementine recognitions for which the original has been lost but exists in a translation made by died 410 two later epitomes of the homilies also exist and there is a partial translation which embraces the recognitions books 1 3 and the homilies books 10 14 preserved in two manuscripts one of which was written in the year some fragments of the clementines are known in and in large portions of the homilies h and recognitions r are almost word for word the same and larger portions also correspond in subject and more or less in treatment however other parts contained only in one appear to be referred to or presupposed in the other the two works are roughly of the same length and contain the same framework of h was considered to be the original by and others thought the first three books of r to be original and h for the remainder argued that both were recensions of an earlier book kerygmata petrou preachings of peter r having best preserved the narrative h the dogmatic teaching and others held r to be the original it is now almost universally held after that h and r are two versions of an original clementine which was longer than either and embraced most of the contents of both sometimes h sometimes r is the more faithful to the archetype narrative within the elaborate philosophical and dogmatic discourse which forms the bulk of both works is interwoven a story which when we consider its date may be described as positively exciting and romantic it differs slightly in the two books the narrative is addressed to the and is related in the voice of clement himself he begins by detailing his religious questionings his doubts about immortality his love for celibacy and so on clement hears at the preaching of a man of judea who relates the of christ r identifies this man as h does not provide a name clement defends this speaker from the mob and follows him to arrival in in h clement likewise sets out for but is driven by storms to where he is directed to and there defends him from the mob and follows to at clement hears that the is there and is about to hold a disputation with at peter s lodging he finds who introduces him peter invites clement to accompany him from city to city on his way to in order to hear his discourses clement so r h crs this duty to peter himself sends a report of this to james from whom peter has an order to transmit to him accounts of all his teaching so far h 1 and r 1 1 21 then the two versions differ the original order may have been as follows clement arises at dawn h 2 1 and finds peter who continues to instruct him 2 18 compare r 2 33 and 3 61 peter sends for two of his disciples nicetas and whom he describes as foster-sons of justa the syrophoenician woman who was healed by christ they had been educated from boyhood by but had been converted by zacchaeus another disciple of peter 19 21 relates simon s parentage and his origin and declares that he claims to be greater than the god who created the world h 2 22 r 2 7 he had been a disciple of who is represented in h as the head of a sect of daily baptizers succeeded john as head of it and simon supplanted 23 4 in r is not mentioned and the sect is said to be led by the woman helena whom simon took about with him is described in r she is called the r 2 12 h 2 26 and the sham he claimed to do h 2 32 r 2 10 he can make himself visible or invisible at will can pass through rocks as if they were clay throw himself down from a mountain unhurt loose himself when bound he can animate statues make trees spring up he can throw himself into the fire without harm can appear with two faces i shall change myself into a sheep or a goat i shall make a beard to grow upon little boys i shall ascend by flight into the air i shall exhibit abundance of gold i shall make and unmake kings i shall be worshipped as god i shall have divine honors publicly assigned to me so that an image of me shall be set up and i shall be adored as god r 2 9 next day at noon zacchaeus announces that simon has put off the promised dispute h 2 35 7 r 2 20 1 peter instructs clement into the evening h 2 38 53 probable lacuna probably before this should come a long passage of r 1 22 74 in which peter speaks of history 27 41 and then gives an account of the coming of the true prophet his rejection passion and resurrection and relates the preaching to the gentiles the church at jerusalem having been governed by james for a week of years the return from their travels and at james s request state what they have accomplished and peter sends to ask if jesus was the christ here peter in a digression explains why the true prophet is called christ and describes the sects then we are told how the argued before and refuted successively the s scribes disciples of john and himself when peter foretells the destruction of the the priests are enraged but quells the tumult and next day makes a speech james preaches james preaches for seven days and the people are on the point of being baptized when an enemy not named but identified by some scholars with excites them against james who is thrown down the steps of the and left for dead james is carried to with 5000 disciples on recovering he sends peter to to refute simon he is welcomed by zacchaeus who relates simon s doings to him perhaps the author of h thought all this story inconsistent with and omitted it in the letter of peter to james peter makes clear the importance of preaching to those who are worthy and to no one else with emphasis on keeping the law of moses and on opposing the man peter refers to as the man who is my enemy debate between peter and simon next morning before dawn peter arouses his disciples h 3 1 r 2 1 who are enumerated h 2 1 r 2 1 peter gives a private preparatory discourse h and then goes out to the public discussion with simon only one day of it is related in h 3 38 57 but the whole matter of the three days is given in r 2 24 70 3 12 30 33 48 but what h has omitted here it gives largely though in a different form in chapters 16 17 18 and partly in 19 as another discussion with simon in it is clear that r has the original order simon being worsted flies in the night to peter determines to follow leaving zaccaeus as bishop at h 3 58 72 r 3 63 6 h adds that peter remained seven days longer and baptized 10 000 people sending on nicetas and to stay at with bernice daughter of their stepmother justa 3 73 but r relates that seven other disciples were sent on while clement remained at for three months with peter who repeated in private at night the public instructions he gave during the day all this clement wrote down and sent to james in chapter 74 the contents of the ten books of these sermons as sent to jerusalem are described h now makes clement nicetas and go on to bernice tells them how simon has been raising ghosts infecting the people with diseases and bringing demons upon them and has gone to clement has a discussion with simon s disciple h 5 7 6 25 all this is omitted by r but the same subjects are discussed in r 10 17 51 peter goes on northward by and to h 7 5 12 r adds and omitting 4 1 peter s discourses to the multitude at are detailed in h books 8 11 and in r three days only 4 6 with considerable differences clement is baptized h 11 35 r 6 15 after a stay of three months he goes through to h 12 1 r 7 1 clement s life story at this point clement recounts his history to peter he was closely related to the soon after his birth his mother had a vision that unless she speedily left with her twin elder sons she and they would perish miserably his father therefore sent them with many servants to but they disappeared and nothing could be learned of their fate at last when clement was twelve years old his father himself set out upon the and he too was no more heard of h 12 9 11 r 7 8 10 in the island of opposite the town peter finds a miserable beggar woman who turns out to be clement s mother peter unites them and heals the woman h 12 12 23 r 7 11 23 h adds a discourse by peter on philanthropy 25 33 the party now leave mattidia clement s mother travels with peter s wife and go by balaneae palates and gable to in syria nicetas and receive them and hear clement s story with surprise they declare themselves to be the twin sons of mattidia and brothers of clement faustus and faustinianus they had been saved on a fragment of wreck and some men in a boat had taken them up they had been beaten and starved and finally sold at stratton to justa who had educated them as her own sons later they had adhered to simon but were brought by zacchaeus to peter upon hearing this mattidia is baptized and peter discourses on the rewards given to chastity h 12 r 7 24 38 the old man the next morning peter is interrupted at his prayers by an old man who assures him that prayer is a mistake since all things are governed by nemesis or fate peter replies h 14 1 5 r names him nicetas and clement try also to refute him 8 5 9 33 compare h 15 1 5 but without success for the old man had cast a for himself and his wife and he explains how it came true clement nicetas and recognize that this man is their father peter asks his name and those of his children faustus their mother rushes in and all embrace in floods of tears faustus is then converted by a long series of discourses on evil and on mythology in r these appear at 10 1 51 in h to 20 1 10 and 4 7 6 25 the discussion between clement and at the long discussions with simon before faustus in h books 16 17 and 18 were in their right place in r as part of the debate at simon is driven away by the threats of but first he changes the face of faustus into his own likeness by smearing it with a magic juice in hopes that faustus will be put to death instead of himself peter frightens away simon s disciples by what are simply lies and he sends faustus to to unsay in the person of simon all the abuse simon has been pouring on the apostle there the people of in consequence long for peter s coming and nearly put the false simon to death peter restores him to his proper form and thenceforth they all live happily clement s letter clement s letter to james forms the epilogue to h in it clement relates how peter on his death bed gave his last instructions and set clement in his own chair as his successor in the see of james is addressed as bishop of bishops who rules jerusalem the holy church of the hebrews and the churches everywhere to him clement sends a book clement s epitome of the preachings of peter from place to place another letter that of peter to james forms an introduction the apostle urges that the book of his teachings is not to be committed to anyone before initiation and probation a note follows the letter relating that james on receipt of the letter called the elders and read it to them the book is to be given only to one who is pious and a teacher and circumcised and even then only a part at a time a form of promise not an oath which is unlawful is prescribed for the reader by heaven earth water and air that he will take extraordinary care of the writings and communicate them to no one he invokes upon himself terrible curses in case he should be unfaithful to this covenant the most curious passage is even if i should come to acknowledge another god i now swear by him whether he exist or not after the adjuration he shall partake of bread and salt the elders on hearing of this solemnity are terrified but james pacifies them early references it was long believed that the early date of the clementines was proved by the fact that they were twice quoted by one of these quotations occurs in the of sts and c 360 dr armitage robinson showed in his ion of that work 1893 that the citation is an addition to the passage of made by the compilers or possibly by a later or the other citation occurs in the old latin translation of on matthew this translation is full of interpolations and alterations and the passage of pseudo-clement is apparently an interpolation by the translator from the omitting the earliest witness is in his iii xxxviii ad 325 he mentions some short writings and adds and now some have only the other day brought forward other wordy and lengthy compositions as being clement s containing dialogues of peter and of which there is absolutely no mention in the ancients these dialogues need not have been the complete but may have been an earlier draft of part of it next we find the clementines used by c 360 they are quoted as the periodi by in 387 and 392 on galatians 1 18 and adv jovin 1 26 two forms of the recognitions were known to and one of them was translated by him c 400 in about 408 inus of nola in a letter to mentions having himself translated a part or all perhaps as an exercise in the opus imperfectum above mentioned has five quotations it is apparently by an of the beginning of the 5th century possibly by a bishop called maximus the translation was made before the date of one of the manuscripts after this time citations occur in many byzantine writers and from the commendation given by 14th century we may gather that an orthodox version was current in the west the translation by became very popular and citations are found in and writings origin and date hypotheses this section may be to readers please help suggestions may be found on the november 2009 in schneemelcher s nta the traditionally standard ion of the

the founder of the of new testament based some of his theories about the new testament on the clementines in turn his ideas about the clementines were based on descriptions by st ca 310 320 403

a false apostle of christ and an apostate from torah-observant judaism asserted that their position also represented the christianity of the twelve inism asserting salvation by faith alone without works of the law was thus regarded as a heresy this ine gospel thus caused a schism from the authentic apostolic jewish or torah-observant christianity originally headed by jesus brother or

necessitated between the petrine and ine factions of the church beginning in the late 2nd century the tradition that peter and co-founded s church in the mid-1st-century and were martyred together is regarded as a fiction the is regarded as a 4th century work produced to show more harmony than actually existed contrary view throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory in many forms was dominant in germany the demonstration mainly by english scholars of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the new testament documents four epistles of st and the apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date and the proofs of the authenticity of the apostolic fathers and of the use of st john s gospel by justin papias and ignatius gradually brought s

under the impression that the original work was known to he is obliged to date it at the end of the 2nd century or the beginning of the third in 1883 bestmann made the clementines the basis of an unsuccessful theory which as puts it claimed for ity the glory of having developed by itself the whole doctrine worship and constitution of catholicism and of having transmitted it to gentile christianity as a finished product which only required to be divested of a few jewish husks another popular theory based upon the clementines has been that it was the epistle of clement to james which originated the notion that st peter was the first bishop of this has been asserted by no lesser authorities than and bright and it has been made an important point in the controversial work of the rev f w puller primitive saints and the roman see it is acknowledged that in st s time c 250 it was universally believed that st peter was bishop of and that he was looked upon as the type and origin of episcopacy modern criticism has long since put the letter of clement too late to allow this theory to be tenable and now places it after 220 and after 260 we shall presently see that it probably belongs to the 4th century the professor in 1890 elaborated a new theory until the he says a new pivot was then needed the made a bold bid for the vacant post of pre-eminence shortly after 135 was published the original form of the clementine it was a roman forgery claiming for the church of peter the succession to a part of the headship of the church of james james indeed had been bishop of bishops and peter s successor could not claim to be more than peter was among the primus inter pares the roman attempt was eventually successful but not without a struggle the capital of roman also claimed the succession to jerusalem the monument of this claim is h a recension of the roman work made at before the end of the 2nd century in order to fight with her own weapons the intention must be admitted to have been closely veiled in the beginning of the 3rd century the metropolis of the orient produced a new ion r claiming for that city the vacant primacy langen s view has found no adherents further scholarship complained that the clementines have left no traces in the eighty years between and but he felt obliged to date them before and placed the original c 200 as the work of a syrian in his history of dogma saw that they had no influence in the 3rd century he dated r and h not earlier than the first half of that century or even a few decades later all the foregoing writers presupposed that the clementines were known to since this has been shown to be not proven 1903 s elaborate study has appeared 1904 but his view was evidently formed earlier his view is that h is the work of an aramaean christian after 325 for he uses the word and earlier than the manuscript r probably after 350 also in the east but the grundschrift or archetype was written at perhaps under the syncretistic system of cult in favour at the court of probably between 220 and 250 in his chronologie ii gives 260 or later as the date but he thinks h and r may be ante-nicene waitz supposes two earlier sources to have been employed in the the kerygmata petrou origin in 1st century but used in a later anti-ite recension and the of peter written in a catholic circle at c 210 accepts the existence of these sources but thinks neither was earlier than about 200 they are carefully to be distinguished from the well-known 2nd century works the and of peter of which fragments still exist these are quoted by many early writers whereas the supposed sources of the clementines are otherwise unknown and therefore probably never existed at all a long passage from de fato of occurs in r ix 19 sqq albrecht and some earlier critics characteristically held that used the clementines merx waitz and most others hold that r cites directly and are certainly right that r has borrowed the citation at second hand from r is certainly post-nicene as waitz has shown but we may go further the curious passage r iii 2 11 which omitted and in which he seemed to hear himself speaking gives in fact the doctrine of so exactly that it frequently almost cites the apologeticus c 362 3 of that heretic word for word the eunomian doctrine is that the essence of god is to be unborn consequently the son who is begotten is not god he is a creature the first-born of all creation and the image of god the holy ghost is the creature of the son the agreement with s ekthesis pisteos of 381 3 is less close as the eunomian passage was found by in both the recensions of clement known to him we may suppose that the interpolation was made in the original work by a eunomian about 365 70 before the abridgment r was made about 370 80 the word archiepiscopus used of st james suggests the end of the 4th century it occurs in the middle of that century in some meletian documents cited by and then not till the 431 the generation of the son h has also a disquisition on the generation of the son xvi 15 18 and xx 7 8 the writer calls god autopator and autogennetos and both mother and father of men his idea of a changeable god and an unchangeable son projected from the best modification of god has been mentioned above this ingenious doctrine enables the writer to accept the words of the nicene definition while denying their sense the son may be called god for so may men be but not in the strict sense he is to patri begotten ek tes ousias he is not treptos or alloiotos apparently he is not ktistos nor was there a time when he was not though this is not quite distinctly enunciated the writer is clearly an who manages to accept the formula of nicea by an acrobatic feat in order to save himself the date is therefore probably within the reign of constantine died 337 while the great council was still imposed on all by the about 330 but this is not the date of h but of the original behind both h and r for it is clear that the eunomian interpolator of r attacks the doctrine we find in h he ridicules autopator and autogennetos he declares god to be unchangeable and the son to be created not begotten from the father s essence and consubstantial god is not masculo-femina it is clear that the interpolator had before him the doctrine of h in a yet clearer form and that he substituted his own view for it r iii 2 11 but it is remarkable that he retained one integral part of h s theory viz the origin of the evil one from an accidental mixture of elements for tells us de adult libr is that he found this doctrine in r and omitted it the date of the original is therefore fixed as after nicea 325 probably c 330 that of h may be anywhere in the second half of the 4th century the eunomian interpolator is about 365 70 and the compilation of r about 370 80 authorship the original author shows a detailed knowledge of the towns on the coast from to he was an and ism had its home in the he uses the of of written about 313 in 325 that historian mentions the dialogues of peter and as just published presumably in his own region these were probably the nucleus of the larger work completed by the same hand a few years later citations of pseudo-clement are by the palestinian who found the among the of by who had dwelt in the syrian desert and settled at bethlehem by the travelled by the compiled in syria or the work is rendered into before the author of the opus imperfectum cited it freely it was interpolated by a eunomian about 365 70 all these indications suggest an author before 350 in the east probably not far from the author though an probably belonged nominally to the catholic church he wrote for the heathens of his day and observed the stiff and often merely formal which the 4th century enforced atonement grace sacraments are omitted for this cause only the true prophet is not a name for christ used by christians but the office of christ which the author puts forward towards the pagan world he shows peter keeping the evening and secret from clement when unbaptized it was no doubt a of bread and wine not of bread and salt the great pagan antagonist of the 3rd century was the philosopher but under constantine his disciple was the chief restorer and defender of the old gods and his system of defence is that which we find made the official religion by 361 3 consequently it is not astonishing to find that simon and his disciples represent not st but the doctrines and practices repelled are astrology divinations and claims to union with the divine which characterized the neo-nism of 320 30 it is not against but against that pseudo-clement teaches the supremacy of the creator of all he defends the against the school of and when he declares it to be interpolated he is using s own higher criticism the elaborate discussion of ancient history the ridicule cast on the mythology of the s and the philosophical explanations of a higher meaning are also against the refutation of idolatry is against late 4th century it is perhaps mere accident that we hear nothing of the clementines from 330 till 360 but about 360 410 they are interpolated they are revised and abridged in h yet more revised and abridged in r translated into latin translated into and frequently cited it seems therefore that it was the policy of which

theorists as a separate field is a relatively late arrival in terms of s however the term political science was not always distinguished from and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also and other fields concerned with determinations of what ought to be and with the characteristics and functions of the ideal the antecedents of western can be traced back to the political philosophers 427 347 bc c 430 354 bc and the father of 384 322 bc these authors in such works as and by and and by analyzed philosophically going beyond earlier greek poetic and historical reflections

oriented toward understanding understanding methods of governing and describing the operation of nearly a thousand years elapsed from the foundation of the city of rome in 753 bc to the fall of the or the beginning of the in the interim there is a manifest translation of culture into the roman sphere the greek gods become romans and greek philosophy in one way or another turns into roman e g the stoic was committed to preserving proper hierarchical roles and duties in the so that the as a whole would remain stable among the best known roman stoics were philosopher and the emperor a wealthy roman patrician is often criticized by some modern commentators for failing to adequately live by his own precepts the mations of on the other hand can be best thought of as the philosophical reflections of an emperor divided between his philosophical aspirations and the duty he felt to defend the from its external enemies through his various military campaigns according to roman institutions were the backbone of the empire but roman is the with the fall of the western there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies the rise of monotheism and particularly for the western tradition brought to light a new space for and political action works such as s synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of redefining the borders between what was

american who participated in the were and modern political science because political science is essentially a study of in all aspects of observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate though methods are increasingly common see political science citing this difficulty former president once said we are limited by the impossibility of experiment is an observational not an science because of this political scientists have historically observed political elites institutions and individual or group behavior in order to identify patterns draw generalizations and build theories of like all s political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in or inanimate objects as in despite the complexities contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science the advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century in fact the designation political scientist is typically reserved for those with a doctorate in the field integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing and the of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both and political

phenomena behavioral revolution and new in the 1950s and the 1960s a behavioral revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behavior swept the discipline a focus on studying rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts characterized early behavioral political science including work by and in the collaboration between sociologist and scholar the late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive formal modeling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline this period saw a surge of re that borrowed and methods from to study political institutions such as the congress as well as such as voting and his colleagues and students at the were the main proponents of this shift recent developments in 2000 the in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it evolutionary theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with however these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today s world this is argued to explain many important features and systematic of current around the world russia de facto political science existed in the as early as in 1960s before it became de jure political science in 1989 in the ussr political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like of and studies of labor movement critique of bourgeois theories etc soviet scholars were represented at the since 1955 since 1960 by the soviet association of political and state studies in 1979 11th world congress of ipsa took place in until the late years of the political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the party of the the development of political science was marked by two major tendencies in the scientific community and in society in general one was a general distrust of political scientists and institutions that were engaged in political science anti-communists accused political scientists of being false scientists and of having served the old regime this atmosphere of animosity created heavy moral and professional strains on those who had worked for the introduction of political science under the old regime they had to face a certain ignorance and ideological animosity from those pretending to be the true bearers of democratic ideals two of the major institutions dealing with political science the institute of contemporary social theories and the institute of international affairs were disbanded and most of their members were actually left without jobs and had to look for new professional careers these institutes were victims of the first wave of euphoria and of in many ways unfounded ideological attacks many of the people working in these institutes were competent scientists with a proficient knowledge of political science and some of them through their works had played an important role in reforming the party and had helped to bring about the radical changes in 1989 today the unites professionals-political scientists from in russia difficulties the main difficulties that haunted its development during the first two decades are still there deficiency of means for re and development of university centers need for funds for re a shortage of academic literature disproportion in allocation of resources between center and periphery deteriorating status of political science in university curriculums at non-political-scientist departments etc at the beginning of 1990s one of the major problems was absence of professionals with special education later in 2000s decade with the first graduations at political-science departments the keenest problem turned out to be low inclusive capacities of the academic labor market there are a lot of problems with connections between political science and political practice subfields most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas including public some political science departments also classify as well as scholarship on the domestic of a particular country as distinct sub fields in contrast to this traditional classification some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories including including and and political institutions including and conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific

clear there are occasional that do not deposit much snow but cover the grasses with enough snow and ice to make grazing impossible killing off tens of thousands of sheep or cattle such losses of livestock which are an inevitable and in a sense normal consequence of the climate have made it difficult for planned increases in livestock numbers to be achieved seasonal snow covers in patches in

enact a land-grant bill to fund a system of industrial colleges one in each state senator of illinois believed it was advisable that the bill should be introduced by an eastern congressman and two months later representative of introduced his bill unlike the turner plan which provided an equal grant to each state the morrill bill allocated land based on the number of senators and representatives each state had in congress this was more advantageous to the more populous eastern states the was first proposed in 1857 and was passed by congress in 1859 but it was vetoed by president in 1861 morrill resubmitted the act with the amendment that the proposed institutions would teach military tactics as well as engineering and agriculture aided by the of many states that did

spearpoints and stone tools may be made of either ground or chipped and a person who creates tools out of the latter is known as a chipped tools are made from materials such as or and via a process

because they are easily manufactured the tool is usually plentiful and they are easy to transport and sharpen 1 6 industries evolutionary development of technocomplexes a selection of tools from the 19th century archaeologists had been turning up worked tools that appeared to be typologically classifiable into taxa they referred to these homotaxial groups of tools as industries and named them after the type site for example after st acheul france and later from in africa in the earlier 20th century they became complexes and technologies in the later technocomplexes in 1969 in the 2nd ion of world prehistory grahame clarke envisioned an evolutionary progression of knapping in which the dominant lithic technologies occurred in a fixed sequence from through mode 5 he assigned to them relative dates modes 1 and 2 to the lower 3 to the middle 4 to the advanced and 5 to the they were not to be conceived however as either universal they did not account for all lithic technology or synchronous in effect simultaneously in different regions for example was in use in europe long after it had been replaced by mode 2 in africa clarke s scheme was adopted enthusiastically by the archaeological community one of its advantages was the simplicity of terminology for example the mode 2 transition the transitions are currently of greatest interest consequently in the literature the tools used in the period of the are divided into four modes each of which designate a different form of complexity and which in most cases followed a rough order mode i the industry wikimedia commons has media related to a typical simple chopping-tool this example is from the douro valley valladolid spain the earliest tools in the life span of the genus are tools and come from what has been termed the industry named after the type of site many sites actually found in where they have been discovered in large quantities tools were characterised by their simple construction predominantly using forms these s were river pebbles or rocks similar to them that had been struck by a spherical hammer to cause removing from one surface creating an edge and often a sharp tip the blunt end is the proximal surface the sharp the distal is a percussion technology grasping the proximal surface the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter such as a bone or tuber the earliest known tools yet found date from 2 6 million years ago during the lower period and have been uncovered at in after this date the industry subsequently spread throughout much of africa although archaeologists are currently unsure which species first developed them with some speculating that it was and others believing that it was in fact habilis habilis was the hominin who used the tools for most of the in africa but at about 1 9-1 8 million years ago erectus inherited them the industry flourished in southern and eastern africa between 2 6 and 1 7 million years ago but was also spread out of africa and into by travelling bands of h erectus who took it as far east as by 1 8 million years ago and northern china by 1 6 million years ago mode ii the industry a typical handaxe this example is from the douro valley spain the small chips on the edge are from reworking wikimedia commons has media related to eventually more complex mode 2 tools began to be developed through the industry named after the site of in france the was characterised not by the but by the the most notable form of which was the the first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1 7 million years ago in the area of and contemporaneously in southern africa the leakeys excavators at olduvai defined a developed period in which they believed they saw evidence of an overlap in and in their species-specific view of the two industries equated to h habilis and to h erectus developed was assigned to habilis and to erectus subsequent dates on h erectus pushed the fossils back to well before tools that is h erectus must have initially used there was no reason to think therefore that developed had to be habilis it could have been erectus opponents of the view divide developed between and there is no question however that habilis and erectus coexisted as habilis fossils are found as late as 1 4 million years ago meanwhile african h erectus developed mode 2 in any case a wave of mode 2 then spread across resulting in use of both there h erectus may not have been the only hominin to leave africa european fossils are sometimes associated with ergaster a contemporary of h erectus in africa in contrast to an tool which is the result of a fortuitous and probably ex tempore operation to obtain one sharp edge on a an tool is a planned result of a manufacturing process the manufacturer begins with a blank either a larger or a slab knocked off a larger rock from this blank he removes large to be used as s standing a on edge on an anvil he hits the exposed edge with centripetal blows of a hard hammer to roughly shape the implement then he works it over again or retouches it with a of wood or bone to produce a tool finely chipped all over consisting of two concave surfaces intersecting in a sharp edge such a tool is used for slicing concussion would destroy the edge and cut the hand some mode 2 tools are disk-shaped others ovoid others leaf-shaped and pointed and others elongated and pointed at the distal end with a blunt surface at the proximal end obviously used for drilling mode 2 tools are used for butchering not being composite having no haft they are not very appropriate killing instruments the killing must have been done some other way mode 2 tools are larger than the blank was ported to serve as an ongoing source of until it was finally retouched as a finished tool itself edges were often sharpened by further retouching mode iii the industry a tool made by the this example is from la parrilla valladolid spain wikimedia commons has media related to eventually the in europe was replaced by a lithic technology known as the industry which was named after the site of in france where examples were first uncovered in the 1860s evolving from the it adopted the to produce smaller and sharper knife-like tools as well as the industry was developed and used primarily by the a native european and middle eastern hominin species mode iv the industry the long rather than of the upper mode 4 industries appeared during the upper the culture is a good example of mode 4 tool production mode v the microlithic industries mode 5 tools involve the production of which were used in composite tools mainly fastened to a haft examples include the culture industries an array of artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and

tools became important during the period these ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained materials such as green and some forms of which are not suitable for flaking the green

using water as a lubricant because of their coarse surfaces some ground tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping but also by use are hand s used in conjunction with for grinding corn or grain polishing increased the intrinsic of the axe polished were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the period when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale during the period large were made from by chipping a rough shape a so-called rough-out such products were traded across a wide area the rough-outs were then polished to give the surface a fine finish to create the axe head polishing not only increased the final strength of the product but also meant that the head could penetrate wood more easily such axe heads were needed in large numbers for forest clearance and the establishment of settlements and farmsteads a characteristic of the period there were many sources of supply including in in and

tools so increasing their life and effectiveness many other tools were developed using the same techniques such products were traded across the country and abroad modern uses the invention of the lock

the marks of his attempt to navigate that space and establish an identity for roman greece he is not a naturalist by any means though he does from time to time comment on the physical realities of the landscape he notices the pine trees on the sandy coast of the deer and the wild boars in the oak woods of and the crows amid the giant oak trees of it is mainly in the last section that touches on the

of digressions on the wonders of nature the signs that herald the approach of an earthquake the phenomena of the tides the ice-bound seas of the north and the noonday sun which at the summer solstice casts no shadow at syene while he never doubts the existence of the gods and heroes he sometimes criticizes the myths and legends relating to them his descriptions of monuments of art are plain and unadorned they bear the impression of reality and their accuracy is confirmed by the extant remains he is perfectly frank in his confessions of ignorance when he quotes a book at second hand he takes

parts of the scientific community against the suggestion made in that humans had arisen from by a process of trans therefore he almost completely ignored the topic of human in despite this precaution the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book s publication for most of the first half of the 19th century the scientific community believed that although geology had shown that the earth and life were very old human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present however a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct by the early 1860s as summarized in s 1863 book it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history this view of human history was more compatible with an ary origin for humanity than was the older view on the other hand at that time there was no evidence to demonstrate human the only human s found before the discovery of in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of that were too close especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates therefore the debate that immediately followed the publication of centered on the similarities and differences between humans and modern carolus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and together as primates in his ground breaking classification system vigorously defended the classification suggested by cuvier and that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view on the other hand sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and in one famous incident which became known as the huxley showed that owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of lacked a structure present in human brains huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book another viewpoint was advocated by and they agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with but questioned whether any purely ic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and especially some aspects of the human mind in 1871 published which contained his views on human argued that the differences between the human mind and the minds of the higher were a matter of degree rather than of kind for example he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to living in social groups he argued that all the differences between humans and were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains and the debate over human origins and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century alternatives to main article the eclipse of ism this photo from s

theistic a term promoted by s greatest american advocate was the idea that god intervened in the process of to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed however this idea ly fell out of favor among as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive by 1900 theistic had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions although it retained a strong popular following in the late 19th century the term neo-ism came to be associated with the position of who viewed the as the most important ary mechanism advocates of this position included the british writer and critic the german biologist and the american paleontologist they considered ism to be philosophically superior to s idea of selection acting on random cope looked for and thought he found patterns of linear progression in the record inheritance of was part of haeckel s of which held that the of an organism repeats its ary history critics of neo-ism such as the german biologist and pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for

innate tendency to change in a unilinear fashion towards ever-greater perfection it had a significant following in the 19th century and its proponents included the biologist and the american paleontologist was popular among some paleontologists who believed that the record showed a and constant unidirectional change saltationism was the idea that new arise as a result of large s it was seen as a much faster alternative to the ian concept of a process of small random s being acted on by and was popular with early geneticists such as and early in his career it became the basis of the theory of diagram from s 1919 book the physical basis of hery showing the sex-linked inheritance of the white-eyed in biometrics and the rediscovery of s laws of inheritance in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists in one camp were the who were focused on discrete s and the laws of inheritance they were led by who coined the word and who coined the word their opponents were the who were interested in the continuous of characteristics within populations their leaders and followed in the tradition of who had focused on measurement and analysis of within a population the rejected on the basis that discrete units of hery such as genes could not explain the continuous range of seen in real populations weldon s work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection

fruit fly he was a saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new could be created in the lab by alone instead the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance his work also demonstrated that most s had relatively small effects such as a change in eye color and that rather than creating a new in a single step s served to increase within the existing population 1920s 1940s see also modern ary synthesis biston betularia f typica is the white-bodied form of the biston betularia f carbonaria is the black-bodied form of the the mendelian and biometrician were eventually reconciled with the of a key step was the work of the british biologist and statistician in a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book er showed that the continuous measured by the could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes and that could change in a population resulting in in a series of papers beginning in 1924 another british geneticist applied analysis to real-world examples of such as the of industrial melanism in s and showed that worked at an even faster rate than er assumed the american biologist who had a background in experiments focused on combinations of interacting genes and the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations that exhibited in 1932 wright introduced the concept of an and argued that and inbreeding could drive a small isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak allowing to drive it towards different adaptive peaks the work of er haldane and wright founded the discipline of this integrated with which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how worked modern ary synthesis in the first few decades of the 20th century most field continued to believe that ian and orthogenetic mechanisms of provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world but as the field of continued to develop those views became less tenable a postdoctoral worker in s lab had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by geneticists such as he helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of micro developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macro observed by field biologists with his 1937 book dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity with marked differences between sub-populations the book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form in great britain the pioneer of ecological continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through such as human ford s work would contribute to a shift in emphasis during the

reproductively isolated from all other populations in the 1944 book showed that the record was consistent with the irregular non-directional pattern predicted by the developing ary synthesis and that

the emerging cross-disciplinary consensus on the workings of would be known as the modern ary synthesis it received its name from the book by the ary synthesis provided a conceptual core in particular and mendelian that tied together many but not all disciplines it helped establish the legitimacy of ary a primarily historical science in a scientific climate that favored experimental methods over historical ones the synthesis also resulted in a considerable narrowing of the range of mainstream ary thought what called the hardening of the synthesis by the 1950s acting on genetic was virtually the only acceptable mechanism of ary change and macro was simply considered the result of extensive micro 1940s 1960s molecular and main article history of molecular the middle decades of the 20th

proteins such as and brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of in the early 1960s biochemists and proposed the molecular clock that sequence differences between could be used to calculate the time since two diverged by 1969 and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock arguing that at the molecular level at least most genetic s are neither harmful nor helpful and that and rather than cause a large portion of genetic change the neutral theory of molecular studies of protein differences within also brought molecular data to bear on by providing estimates of the level of in natural populations from the early 1960s molecular was increasingly seen as a threat to the traditional core of ary established ary biologists particularly and g g simpson three of the architects of the modern synthesis were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches especially when it came to the connection or lack thereof to the molecular-clock and the neutral theory were particularly controversial spawning the over the relative importance of drift and selection which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution late 20th century gene-centered view in the mid-1960s strongly critiqued explanations of adaptations worded in terms of survival of the arguments such explanations were largely replaced by a gene-centered view of epitomized by the arguments of

reproduction would help maintain resistance against rapidly evolving parasites thus making sexual reproduction common despite the tremendous cost from the gene-centric point of view of a system where only half of an organism s is passed on during reproduction the gene-centric view has also led to an increased interest in s old idea of and more recently in topics such as and socio s work on

formulated the inequality in known as which showed how in insects the existence of sterile worker classes and many other examples of altruistic behavior could have evolved through other theories followed some derived from such as in 1975 published the influential and highly controversial book socio the new synthesis which claimed ary theory could help explain many aspects of animal including human behavior critics of socio including and claimed that socio greatly overstated the degree to which complex human behaviors could be determined by genetic factors they also claimed that the theories of sociobiologists often reflected their own ideological biases despite these criticisms work has continued in socio and the related discipline of ary including work on other aspects of the

these genomic analyses have produced fundamental changes in the understanding of the ary such as the proposal of the by advances in computational hardware and software allow the testing and

ideas from and and emphasized the processes of as factors directing the course of the ary biologist revived earlier ideas of alterations in the relative rates of al processes over the course of to account for the generation of novel forms and with the ary biologist wrote an influential paper in 1979 suggesting that a change in one structure or even a structural novelty could arise incidentally as an accidental result of selection on another structure rather than through direct selection for that particular adaptation they called such incidental structural changes after an architectural feature later gould and vrba discussed the acquisition of new functions by novel structures arising in this fashion calling them molecular data regarding the mechanisms underlying accumulated rapidly during the 1980s and 90s it became clear that the diversity of animal was not the result of different sets of proteins regulating the of different but from changes in the deployment of a small set of proteins that were common to all these proteins became known as the al toolkit such perspectives influenced the disciplines of phylo and comparative al and spawned the new discipline of ary al also known as evo-devo 21st century macro and micro one of the tenets of the modern ary synthesis was that macro the of phylogenic clades at the level and above was solely the result of the mechanisms of micro changes in gene frequency within populations operating over an extended period of time during the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors such as and operating on the level of entire and even higher level phylogenic clades needed to be considered to explain patterns in revealed by analysis of the record near the end of the 20th century some reers in ary al suggested that interactions between the and the al process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macro but other evo-devo reers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macor epigenetic inheritance main article epi epi is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying sequence by the first decade of the 21st century it had become accepted that epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the ary origin of although epi in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation with epigenetic patterns reset when organisms reproduce there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance this shows that in some cases non genetic changes to an organism can be inherited and it has been suggested that such inheritance can help with adaptation to local conditions and affect some have suggested that in certain cases a form of ian may occur unconventional ary theory omega point s metaphysical describes the

25 1908 december 25 2000 known to intimates as van was an and in the from 1930 until his death 70 years later quine was continually affiliated with in one way or another first as a student then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement he filled the edgar pierce chair of at harvard from 1956 to 1978 a recent poll conducted among philosophers named quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries he won the first schock prize in and in 1993 for his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning quine falls squarely into the philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not merely his major writings include 1951 which attacked the distinction between and and advocated a form of and 1960 which further developed these positions and introduced quine s famous thesis advocating a he also developed an influential that tried to provide an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input he is also important in for his systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science this led to his famous quip that is philosophy enough in he and his harvard colleague developed the an argument for the 2 1 rejection of the distinction 2 2 and 2 4 2 5 biography according to his autobiography the of my life 1986 quine grew up in where he lived with his parents and older brother robert c his father cloyd r was a manufacturing entrepreneur and his mother harriett e also known as hattie according to the 1920 census was a schoolteacher and later a housewife he received his b a in mathematics from in 1930 and his ph d in philosophy from in 1932 his thesis supervisor was he was then appointed a which excused him from having to teach for four years during the academic year 1932 33 he travelled in europe thanks to a sheldon fellowship meeting polish s including and members of the including as well as the logical positivist it was through quine s good offices that was invited to attend the september 1939 congress in cambridge to attend that congress sailed for the usa on the last ship to leave before the invaded poland survived the war and worked another 44 years in the usa during world war ii quine lectured on logic in brazil in portuguese and served in the united states navy in a role deciphering messages from german submarines and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander at harvard quine helped supervise the harvard theses of among others and for the academic year 1964-1965 quine was a fellow on the faculty in the center for advanced studies at quine had four children by two marriages guitarist was his nephew political beliefs quine was politically conservative but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues he did however write in defense of several conservative positions for example in quiddities an intermittently philosophical dictionary he wrote a defense of while in his autobiography he made some criticisms of american postwar academic culture quine like many philosophers in the anglo-american tradition was critical of in 1992 quine led an unsuccessful petition to stop from granting derrida an honorary degree such criticism was according to derrida directed at derrida no doubt because derrida s methods called deconstructions query or put into question a good many divisions and distinctions for example the distinction between the pretended neutrality of philosophical discourse on the one hand and existential passions and drives on the other between what is public and what is private and so on quine regarded derrida s work as or academic genealogy notable teachers notable students work quine s ph d thesis and early publications were on and only after wwii did he by virtue of seminal papers on and language emerge as a major philosopher by the 1960s he had worked out his whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the s quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a first philosophy a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to and capable of justifying it these views are intrinsic to his quine could lecture in french spanish portuguese and german as well as his native english but like the logical positivists he evinced little interest in the philosophical canon only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy on hume quine has an of 3 rejection of the distinction see also in the 1930s and 1940s discussions with and among others led quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between statements those true simply by the meanings of their words such as all bachelors are unmarried and statements those true or false by virtue of facts about the world such as there is a cat on the mat this distinction was central to although quine is not normally associated with some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language citing his harvard colleague and his analysis of language in like other philosophers before him quine accepted the of as true in virtue of meaning alone unlike them however he concluded that ultimately the was in other words quine accepted that statements are those that are true by then argued that the notion of truth by was unsatisfactory quine s chief objection to ity is with the notion of sameness of meaning a sentence being just in case it substitutes a synonym for one black in a proposition like all black things are black or any other the objection to hinges upon the problem of collateral information we intuitively feel that there is a distinction between all unmarried men are bachelors and there have been black dogs but a competent english speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to collateral information bearing on the historical existence of black dogs quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or truths another approach to quine s objection to ity and emerges from the modal notion of a traditional view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds quine finds the notion of such a space problematic arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true and the central theses underlying the and other extensions of quine s work are and the related of the premise of confirmation is that all theories and the derived from them are under-determined by empirical data data sensory-data evidence although some theories are not justifiable failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex there are many equally justifiable alternatives while the greeks assumption that unobservable ic gods exist is false and our supposition of unobservable electromagnetic waves is true both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations quine concluded his as follows as an empiricist i continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool ultimately for predicting future experience in the light of past experience physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by in terms of experience but simply as irreducible posits comparable epistemologically to the gods of for my part i do qua lay physicist believe in physical objects and not in s gods and i consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise but in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits quine s ontological evident in the passage above led him to agree with that for any collection of empirical evidence there would always be many theories able to account for it however duhem s is much more restricted and limited than quine s for duhem underdetermination applies only to or possibly to while for quine it applies to all of human knowledge thus while it is possible to verify or whole theories it is not possible to verify or individual statements almost any particular statements can be saved given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory for quine scientific thought forms a web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part quine s writings have led to the wide acceptance of in the and its contrary the problem of is an old puzzle in philosophy which quine captured eloquently when he wrote a curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity it can be put into three anglo-saxon monosyllables what is there it can be answered moreover in a word everything and everyone will accept this answer as true more directly the controversy goes how can we talk about to what does the word refer if our answer is something then we seem to believe in mystical entities if our answer is nothing then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this certainly when we said that was a mythological winged horse we make sense and moreover we speak the truth if we speak the truth this must be truth about something so we cannot be speaking of nothing quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them however criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain lejewski writes further this state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory the idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information which may not be forthcoming is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences existential generalization and universal instantiation may prove worth our while lejewski then goes on to offer a description of which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem lejewski also points out that additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic which left lejewski unsatisfied over the course of his career quine published numerous technical and expository papers on some of which are reprinted in his selected papers and in the ways of quine confined logic to classical bivalent hence to truth and falsity under any nonempty hence the following were not logic for quine higher order logic and he famously referred to as in disguise much of what included in logic was not logic for quine s involving notions especially quine was especially hostile to modal logic with a battle he largely lost when s became canonical for quine wrote three undergraduate texts on ary while teaching an introductory course in 1940 quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to theory or quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an solution to his teaching needs methods of the four ions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic quine taught from the end of wwii until his 1978 retirement of a concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of quinian themes such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions the dubiousness of and the non-logical character of higher-order logic mathematical is based on quine s graduate teaching during the 1930s and 40s it shows that much of what took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages the proofs are concise even cryptic the last chapter on and along with the article quine 1946 became a launching point for s later lucid exposition of these and related results quine s work in logic gradually became dated in some respects techniques he did not teach and discuss include tableaux and his treatment of left something to be desired for example mathematical does not include any proofs of and early in his career the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic his later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method as exposited in his methods of for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights and the fine prose in which he expressed them most of quine s original work in from 1960 onwards was on variants of his one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without for a comprehensive treatment of and its history see quine 1976 for an introduction see chpt 45 of his methods of quine was very warm to the possibility that would

logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results it is in that quine was most innovative he always maintained that mathematics required and that was quite distinct from logic he flirted with s for a while but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics over the course of his career quine proposed three variants of axiomatic each including the nf

a stratified formula is one that would allow were the to include however quine s does not feature the of nf are curious nf allows many large sets the now-canonical does not allow even sets for which the does not hold since the holds for all finite sets the failure of this axiom in nf proves that nf includes infinite sets the relative consistency of nf is an open question a modification of nf due to r b jensen and admitting entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements turns out to be consistent relative to thus vindicating the intuition behind nf nf and are the only quinian set theories with a following for a derivation of foundational mathematics in nf see rosser 1953 the of mathematical is nf augmented by the of von neumann except axiomatized in a much simpler way the of

quine s theory of virtual sets and relations and surveyed axiomatic as it stood circa 1960 however and 1973 do a better job of surveying as it stood at mid-century all three set theories admit a universal class but since they are free of any of they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level quine s and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits each

in his career that all of first order logic and could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions and for an elegant introduction to the parsimony of quine s approach to logic see his for mathematical

knowledge this approach he argued has failed to give us any real understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge quine recommended that as an alternative we look to s like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge thus we must totally replace our entire epistemological paradigm quine s proposal is extremely controversial among contemporary philosophers and has

stipulated salary from the institution so that the trustees could instead put the school s income towards paying faculty and improving the grounds in 1900 the board of trustees found themselves so thoroughly in debt to cocke that the school was deeded to him and his family 1901-1932 matty cocke and accration charles lewis cocke s death in 1901 at the age of eighty-one was a grave moment for the

atmosphere her father had cultivated at hollins though she was a charismatic leader and the first woman to head a college in miss cocke was not interested in waging any battles for women s education indeed she let her nephews joseph turner and m estes cocke handle the school s financial dealings entirely miss cocke shared the opinion of president john mcbryde of in nearby who in 1907 decried the independence sought by and other members of the and suggested instead that women s education focus on grace and refinement in 1911 the school was renamed hollins college the cocke family literally

southern were certified by professional organizations as standard while both hollins and were designated as approximate the cocke family agreed to turn over ownership if sufficient funds were raised in 1925 but the slowed their efforts a scathing 1930 letter from alumna eudora ramsay richardson in the south atlantic quarterly indicted the for regional bias richardson s letter and prompting from

speculative idea about the condition of those who die in without being assigned to the of the damned is not an official doctrine of the or any other medieval theologians in western europe described the hell infernum as divided into four distinct parts of the damned which some call and of the patriarchs in by the of the patriarchs or of the fathers latin patrum is seen as the temporary state of those who in spite of the personal sins they may have committed died in the friendship of but could not enter until redemption by made it possible the term of the fathers was a medieval name for the part of the where the patriarchs of the were believed to be kept until s soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them see harrowing of the catechism of the describes s descent into hell as meaning primarily that the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his this was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to s descent into hell that like all men experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead it adds but he descended there as saviour proclaiming the good news to the spirits imprisoned there it does not use the word the of the fathers was the abode of people who before resurrection had died in the friendship of but had to wait for to open s gates this concept of affirms that one can get into only through but does not portray etc as being punished eternally in like other religious terms such as the term does not appear in the bible and like other religious concepts that of the of the patriarchs is not spelled out in scripture but is seen by some as implicit in various references speaks of the which both the roman and the ern orthodox church following early ian writers understand as a temporary state of souls awaiting entrance into the end of that state is set either at the the most common interpretation in the or at the harrowing of the most common interpretation in the but adopted also by some in the told the that the two of them would be together this day in see also but between on the sunday of his he said that he had not yet some say that the descent of to the abode of the dead his presence among them turned it into a paradise others understand the text to mean not i say to you this day you will be with me in paradise but i say to you this day you will be with me in paradise explained the today as a reference to the today of eternity is also described as preaching to the spirits in prison 1 pet 3 19 sometimes portrayed leading a dramatic assault the harrowing of during the three days between the and the in this assault freed the souls of the just and escorted them triumphantly into this imagery is still used in the ern orthodox church s between and and in ern orthodox of the resurrection of the doctrine expressed by the term of the fathers was taught for instance by who maintained it is not right that these should be condemned without trial and that those alone who lived after the coming of should have the advantage of the divine righteousness ern depiction of in his raising also of infants the of infants latin infantium or puerorum is a hypothesis about the permanent status of the who die in too young to have committed personal sins but not having been freed from since at least the time of theologians considering to be necessary for the salvation of those to whom it can be administered have debated the fate of innocents and the theory of the of infants is one of the hypotheses that have been formulated as a proposed solution some who hold this theory regard the of infants as a state of maximum natural happiness others as one of mildest punishment consisting at least of privation of the and of any hope of obtaining it this theory in any of its forms has never been dogmatically by the church but it is permissible to hold it recent catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope that these infants may attain instead of the supposed state of while the has a doctrine on it has none on the eternal fate of infants leaving theologians free to propose different theories which catholics are free to accept or reject the fundamental importance in roman catholic of the of water gives rise to the argument that because excludes from the enjoyed by the souls in those who have not been freed from it either by the or by of desire or of blood are not eligible for entry into latin fathers saint of hippo held that because of such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all that person therefore greatly deceives both himself and others who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation whereas the apostle says judgment from one offence to condemnation and again a little after by the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation the council of north african bishops which included of hippo held at carthage in 418 did not explicitly endorse all aspects of s stern view about the destiny of infants who die without but the latin fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries did adopt his position and it became a point of reference for latin theologians in the middle ages medieval theologians in the later medieval period some theologians continued to hold s view in the 12th century 1079 1142 said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment just the pain of loss at being denied the others held that infants suffered no pain at all unaware of being deprived of the they enjoyed a state of natural not supernatural happiness this theory was associated with but independent of the term of infants which was forged about the year 1300 if is a state of supernatural happiness and union with and hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from then in this view the of infants although technically part of hell the outermost part meaning outer edge or hem is seen as a sort of intermediate state saint described the of infants as an eternal state of natural joy untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptized he argued that this was a reward of natural happiness for natural virtue a reward of supernatural happiness for merely natural virtue would be inappropriate since due to children lack the necessary supernatural in regards to of desire aquinas stated that only adults were capable of this and this view seemed to be accepted by the which quotes aquinas in its eleventh session concerning of infants the natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of mediated through creatures as stated in the s document on the question because children below the age of reason did not commit actual sin theologians came to the common view that these children feel no pain at all or even that they enjoy a full though only natural happiness through their mediated union with in all natural goods duns scotus in some ways this state bears a strong resemblance to the goal of -seeing in all things and would be a form of happiness rarely attained by any human walking the earth modern era the teaching of the roman expressed in the catechism of the is that baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this and that since has bound salvation to the of baptism but he himself is not bound by his s baptism of blood as in the case of the martyrs who are understood to include the and for catechumens at least the explicit desire for baptism together with repentance for their sins and charity baptism of desire ensure salvation for those unable to receive baptism by water the 1442 spoke of as necessary even for children and required that they be baptised soon after birth this had earlier been affirmed at the local in 417 the also stated that those who die in alone go to hell s attack on the necessity of infant was condemned by another general council the the in 1547 explicitly stated that or desire for was the means by which one is transferred from that state wherein man is born a child of the first adam to the state of and of the adoption of the sons of through the second adam our saviour if adults could effectively be baptised through a desire for the when prevented from actually receiving it some speculated that perhaps ally unbaptised infants too might be saved by some waterless equivalent of ordinary when prevented a major 16th-century theologian suggested that infants dying in the womb before birth and so before ordinary al could be administered might be saved through their mother s wish for their thus there was no clear consensus that the had excluded salvation of infants by such extra-al equivalents of through the 18th and 19th centuries individual theologians bianchi in 1768 h klee in 1835 caron in 1855 h schell in 1893 continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved by 1952 a theologian such as could in a widely used and well-regarded manual openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for though he still represented their going to as the commonly taught opinion in its 1980 instruction on children s the stated that with regard to children who die without having received the church can only entrust them to the mercy of as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them leaving all theories as to their fate including as viable options and in 1984 when then cardinal prefect of that congregation stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised cannot attain salvation he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background thus in 1992 the catechism of the while affirming that the church does not know of any means other than baptism that assures entry into eternal beatitude but also stating that has bound salvation to the of baptism but he himself is not bound by his s stated as regards children who have died without baptism the church can only entrust them to the mercy of as she does in her funeral rites for them indeed the great mercy of who desires that all men should be saved and tenderness toward children which caused him to say let the children come to me do not hinder them allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without baptism all the more urgent is the church s call not to prevent little children coming to through the gift of holy baptism this merely restating what was said above suggesting a hope that there could be a way of salvation not shown to us through revelation which hope being uncertain leaves in place the urgency of for infants since this is the only certain means to not prevent their coming to in order to have salvation on april 22 2007 the advisory body known as the released a document originally commissioned by entitled the hope of salvation for infants who die without being baptized after tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of infants including that connected with the theory of the of infants and after examining the theological arguments the document stated its conclusion as follows our conclusion is that the many factors that we have considered above give serious theological and liturgical grounds for hope that infants who die will be saved and enjoy the we emphasize that these are reasons for prayerful hope rather than grounds for sure knowledge there is much that simply has not been revealed to us we live by faith and hope in the of mercy and love who has been revealed to us in and the spirit moves us to pray in constant thankfulness and joy what has been revealed to us is that the ordinary way of salvation is by the of none of the above considerations should be taken as qualifying the necessity of or justifying delay in administering the rather as we want to reaffirm in conclusion they provide strong grounds for hope that will save infants when we have not been able to do for them what we would have wished to do namely to baptize them into the faith and life of the church authorized publication of this document indicating that he considers it consonant with the church s teaching though it is not an official expression of that teaching media reports that by the document the pope closed are thus without foundation in fact the document explicitly states that the theory of understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to and without and who therefore neither merit the nor yet are subjected to any punishment because they are not guilty of any personal sin this theory elaborated by theologians beginning in the middle ages never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the magisterium still that same magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the second vatican council it remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis second preliminary paragraph and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of remains a possible theological opinion the document thus allows the hypothesis of a of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised a question on which there is no explicit answer from scripture or tradition it ought also to be mentioned here that the traditional theological alternative to was not but rather some degree of suffering in at any rate these theories are not the official teaching of the but are only opinions that the church does not condemn ting them to be held by its members just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without in other denominations and religions the righteous follow from to russian icon neither the ern orthodox church nor accepts the concept of a of infants but while not using the expression of the patriarchs the ern orthodox church

full from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to diagram of macroeconomic circulation ls ld is the full situation one in which the rate of is zero or negative corresponding to a labor shortfall full in is the level of rates when there is no it is defined by the majority of as being an acceptable level of natural above 0 the discrepancy from 0 being due to non-cyclical un above 0 is advocated as necessary to control which has brought about the concept of the non-accelerating inflation rate of un the majority of mean when speaking of full 2 3 economic concept what most neo mean by full is a rate somewhat less than 100 considering slightly lower levels desirable others such as vehemently disagree considering full as 0 rates of substantially above 0 have also been attacked by the conservative belief that there is some law of nature which prevents men from being employed that it is rash to employ men and that it is financially sound to maintain a tenth of the population in idleness for an indefinite period is crazily improbable the sort of thing which no man could believe who had not had his head fuddled with nonsense for years and years the objections which are raised are mostly not the objections of experience or of practical men they are based on highly abstract theories venerable academic inventions half misunderstood by those who are applying them today and based on assumptions which are contrary to the facts our main task therefore will be to confirm the reader s instinct that what seems sensible is sensible and what seems nonsense is nonsense j m keynes in a pamphlet to support in the 1929 election the 20th century british economist stated that an rate of 3 was full other have provided estimates between 2 and 13 depending on the country time period and the various political biases before and chapter 15 developed a version of the unlike the current view he saw a range of full rates he distinguished between high full the lowest sustainable under and low full the lowest sustainable rate without these policies technical terms ideal an alternative more normative definition used by some labor would see full as the attainment of the ideal rate where the that reflect labor-market inefficiency such as do not exist only some would exist where workers are temporarily ing for new jobs for example lord defined full as where the number of unemployed workers equaled the number of job vacancies available he preferred that the economy be kept above that full level in order to allow maximum economic production long run aggregate supply the concept of full has so far been used in conjunction with the long run aggregate supply lras curve where long run is also the full level of output full does not mean that there is zero but rather that all of the people willing and able to work have jobs at the current wage rate full is the quantity of labour employed when the labour market is in equilibrium main article before and after expansionary policy with long-run the following should be understood in discussions of s that follow it are attempting to keep at certain levels usually over four percent and as high as ten or more percent by keeping interest rates high as interest rates increase more bankruptcies of individuals and businesses occur meaning less money to hire staff or purchase goods the making and distributing of which requires workers which means jobs it might also be noted that the main cause of is not high but rather the ability of banks to make money with little to no backing with things of value commodities such as gold and silver are some examples thus flooding the market with money and decreasing the value of each dollar already issued in the process assuming the economy has not kept up to this increase in issued loans economists such as and dr ravi batra have theorized ways that a modern economy could have low and near full as in close to 100 of those who are not students and are healthy enough to work and who wish to work at any given point in time as of yet these have yet to be widely disseminated through the press or introduced by most s paul martin former finance minister and past of canada once held that full could be achieved yet let go of this idea after gaining power friedman s view has prevailed so that in much of modern full means the lowest level of that can be sustained given the structure of the economy using the terminology first introduced by following the lead of this equals the non-accelerating inflation rate of un when the real equals this concept is identical to the natural rate but reflects the fact that there is nothing natural about an economy at this level of there is no above the level of the that is at full there is no cyclical or deficient-demand if the rate stays below this natural or threshold level for several years it is posited that will accelerate i e get worse and worse in the absence of wage and price controls similarly will get better decelerate if rates exceed the for a long time the theory says that does not rise or fall when the equals the natural rate this is where the term is derived the level of the thus depends on the degree of supply side i e joblessness that can t be abolished by high demand this includes and ideas associated with the questioned the possibility and value of full in a society this theory suggests that full especially as defined normatively will be associated with positive the tells us also that there is no single number that one can single out as the full rate instead there is a between and a might choose to attain a lower rate but would pay for it with higher rates in 1968 leader of the school of economics and posited a unique full rate of what they called the natural rate of but this is seen not as a normative choice as much as something we are stuck with even if it is unknown rather than trying to attain full friedman argues that policy-makers should try to keep prices stable a low or even a zero rate if this policy is sustained he suggests that the economy will gravitate to the natural rate of automatically structural main article structural some economists estimate a range of possible rates for example in 1999 in the united states the oecd gives an estimate of the full rate of 4 to 6 4 this is the estimated rate the when there is full plus minus the of the estimate estimates for other countries are also available from the oecd full employability full employability indicates an attempt by to make people employable by both positive means e g training courses and negative means e g cuts in benefits it does not necessarily create full technical issues whatever the definition of full it is difficult to discover exactly what rate it corresponds to in the united states for example the economy saw stable despite low during the late 1990s contradicting most estimates of the the idea that the full rate is not a unique number has been seen in recent empirical re staiger stock and watson found that the range of possible values of the from 4 3 to 7 3 was too large to be useful to macroeconomic policy-makers suggested that for 1956-95 there was a zone from about 5 to about 10 between the low realm of accelerating and the high realm of dis in between he found that falls with falling worse the doesn t stay the same over time and can change due to economic policy for example some argue that british s anti policies using persistently high led to higher and a higher policy the active pursuit of national full through interventionist policies is associated with and marked the postwar agenda of many western nations until the of the 1970s was the first country in the world in which full in a free society was made official policy by its on may 30 1945 the n labor party and his minister proposed a in the n house of representatives titled full in the first time any apart from regimes had unequivocally committed itself to providing work for any person who was willing and able to work conditions of full lasted in from 1941 to 1975 this had been preceded by the 1907 establishing the a while this earlier case was overturned it remained influential united states the united states is as a statutory matter committed to full defined as 3 for persons 20 and older 4 for persons aged 16 and over the is empowered to effect this goal the relevant legislation is the 1946 initially the full later amended in the 1978 the 1946 act was passed in the aftermath of when it was feared that demobilization would result in a depression as it had following in the while the 1978 act was passed following the and in the midst of continuing high the law states that full is one of four economic goals in concert with growth in production and and that the us shall rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve these goals specifically the act is committed to an rate of no more than 3 for persons aged 20 or over and not more than 4 for persons aged 16 or over from 1983 onwards and the act expressly allows but does not require the to create a reservoir of public to effect this level of these jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector however since the passage of this act in 1978 the us has as of 2012 never achieved this level of nor has such a reservoir of public been created main article some particularly post-keynesian have suggested ensuring full via a program where those who are unable to find work in the private sector are employed by

turned to lifetime slaves who worked for their keep but were not paid wages and could not easily escape slaves had some legal rights it was a crime to kill a slave and a few whites were hanged for it generally the slaves developed their own family system religion and customs in the slave quarters with little interference from owners who were only interested in work outputs by 1700 there were 25 000 slaves in the american colonies about 10 of the population a few had come from africa but most came from the west indies especially trinidad later trinidad and tobago or increasingly were native born their legal status was now clear they were slaves for life and so were the children of slave mothers they could be sold or freed and a few ran away slowly a free black population emerged

years after the revolution more southerners also freed slaves sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder s death in the upper south the percentage of free blacks rose from about 1 before the revolution to more than 10 by 1810 and worked to persuade slaveholders to free families in the number of free blacks increased from 10 000 in 1790 to nearly 30 000 in 1810

democrats had used a combination of violence fraud and intimidation since the election of 1868 these techniques were prominent among paramilitary groups such as the league and in and florida prior to the 1876 elections in for instance one historian estimated that 150 blacks were killed in the weeks before the election massacres occurred at and ellenton paramilitary violence against s intensified

democrats first passed laws to make voter registration and elections more complicated most of the rules acted overwhelmingly against blacks but many poor whites were also interracial coalitions of populists and republicans in some states succeeded in controlling legislatures in the 1880s and 1894 which made the democrats more determined to reduce voting by poorer classes when democrats took

of 16 when his family settling near his father was a marketing executive for farm machinery manufacturer his uncle david colvin worked for and ended up colvin attended high school in and studied and

issue timeline of the afghan detainee issue and 2010 canada wikinews has related news diplomat and whistleblower richard colvin files complaint against harper government on october 6 2009 the lawyer for colvin called to testify at a hearing into allegations of afghan prison torture said that the government was trying to keep her client silent in a letter sent to the and obtained by lawyer lori bokenfohr said the government invoked the national security order in response to colvin s decision to co-operate with the colvin said canada did not monitor detainee conditions in and that detainees transferred by s to afghan prisons were likely tortured according to our information the likelihood is that all the afghans we handed over were tortured colvin said for interrogators in kandahar it was a standard operating procedure colvin worked in kandahar for the department of foreign affairs in 2006 before moving to kabul where he was second-in-command at the embassy he said his reports were ignored and he was eventually told to stop putting the reports in writing however mr colvin s testimony had been politely but steadily chipped away by evidence from other witnesses that included three former ambassadors to and other senior officials from the department of foreign affairs and international trade who were assigned to the file a representative from the correctional service of canada who was in kandahar and made 47 visits to prisons most of them unannounced and by a number of serving and retired general officers globe and mail c blatchford 14 may 2010 on the other hand in the high court of england and wales 2010 ewhc 1445 gave mr colvin s testimony considerable weight arguments that the high court did not have benefit of the full testimony can be balanced against much other corollary evidence considered in the judgement for example paragraphs 74 75 in 2008 the american state department and the foreign affairs committee of the british house of commons both asserted that the risk of torture by afghan authorities was real and well-known significantly less weight was attributed to colvin s testimony by the in its final report on the subject of afghan detainee transfers tabled on 27 june 2012 testifying under cross-examination in a quasi-judicial as opposed to a sympathetic partisan political forum colvin was judged to have been out of the loop with regards to detainee matters in the time period covered by the amnesty international and british columbia civil liberties association complaint under cross-examination colvin also admitted that my understanding of international law is quite sketchy in the end the commission found that the amnesty international complaint of misconduct against the eight military police subjects was unsubstantiated considering that the amnesty international complaint to the is the forum where richard colvin first catapulted to national prominence his testimony there was anti-climactic and underwhelming apart from his witness duties richard colvin currently holds an appointment as first secretary at the foreign service institute s centre of learning for international affairs and management the centre provides

mobilized and sent to the island the siege of monastery became particularly well known in november 1866 about 250 cretan greek combatants and around 600 women and children were besieged by about 23

truce expired the army resumed its offensive and the n position quickly became desperate on october 31 issued an ultimatum requiring the to stop the hostilities and sign a new truce with within 48 hours this was supported by the partial mobilization of the army up to 20 divisions the sultan accepted the conditions of the ultimatum to resolve the crisis on december 11 1876 the conference of the

peaceful settlement after reaching an agreement with its main balkan rival and with anti sympathies running high throughout europe due to the atrocities and the rejection of the agreements finally felt free to declare war course of the war opening manoeuvres declared war on the s on 24 april 1877 and its troops entered through the newly built near ungheni on the prut river the n king had

attack the turks resulting in bombardments of n towns on the on may 10 1877 the principality of which was under formal rule declared its independence at the beginning of the war the outcome was far from obvious the s could send a larger army into the about 300 000 troops were within reach the s had about 200 000 troops on the balkan peninsula of which about 100 000 were assigned to fortified garrisons leaving about 100 000 for the army of operation the s had the advantage of being fortified complete command of the and patrol boats along the river they also possessed superior arms including new british and american-made rifles and german-made artillery crossing of the 1883 in the event however the s usually resorted to passive defense leaving the strategic initiative to the s who after making some mistakes found a winning strategy for the war the military command in made poor assumptions of intentions they decided that s would be too lazy to march along the and cross it away from the delta and would prefer the short way along the coast this would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest best supplied and garrisoned fortresses there was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river it was garrisoned only because the troops led by had just taken part in defeating the serbs in their recent war against the the campaign was better planned but it relied heavily on passivity a crucial mistake was sending too few troops initially the was crossed in june by an expionary force of about 185 000 which was slightly less than the combined forces in the about 200 000 after setbacks in july at and the military command realized it did not have the reserves to keep the offensive going and switched to a defensive posture the s did not even have enough forces to blockade properly until late august which effectively delayed the whole campaign for about two months balkan theatre fighting near ivanovo-chiflik n and troop movements at at the start of the war and destroyed all vessels along the and the river thus ensuring that forces could cross the at any point without resistance from the navy the command did not appreciate the significance of the s actions in june a small unit crossed the close to the delta at and marched towards ruschuk today this made the s even more confident that the big force would come right through the middle of the stronghold under the direct command of major-general on the night of 27 28 june 1877 the s constructed a pontoon bridge across the at after a short battle in which the s suffered 812 killed and wounded the secured the opposing bank and drove off the infantry brigade defending at this point the force was divided into three parts the eastern detachment under the command of alexander alexandrovich the future tsar i of assigned to capture the fortress of ruschuk and cover the army s eastern flank the western detachment to capture the fortress of and cover the army s western flank and the advance detachment under count which was assigned to quickly move via and penetrate the the most significant barrier between the and responding to the crossing of the the high command in ordered to advance east from occupy the fortress of just west of the crossing on his way to learned that the s had already captured the fortress and so moved to the crossroads town of now known as which he occupied with a force of approximately 15 000 on 19 july the s approximately 9 000 under the command of general schilder-schuldner reached early in the morning thus began the siege of map of the war organized a defense and repelled two attacks with huge casualties on the side at that point the sides were almost equal in numbers and the army was very discouraged most analysts agree that a counter-attack would have allowed the s to gain control of and destroy the s bridge however had orders to stay fortified in and so he did not leave that fortress gazi capitulation at had no more troops to throw against so the s besieged it and subsequently asked the ns to provide extra troops on august 9 made an attempt to help with 30 000 troops but he was stopped by s at the after three days of fighting the volunteers were relieved by a force led by general radezky and the forces withdrew soon afterwards n forces crossed the and joined the siege on august 16 at gorni-studen the armies west army group around were placed under the command of the n prince aided by the general pavel dmitrievich zotov and the n general alexandru cernat taking of the grivitsa redoubt by the s a few hours later the redoubt was recaptured by the s and fell to the ns on 30 august 1877 in what became known as the third battle of grivitsa the turks maintained several fortresses around which the and n forces gradually reduced the n 4th division led by general george manu took the grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults and managed to keep it until the very end of the siege the siege of july december 1877 turned to victory only after and n forces cut off all supply routes to the fortified s with supplies running low made an attempt to break the siege in the direction of opanets on december 9 in the middle of the night the s threw bridges over the vit river and crossed it attacked on a 2-mile 3 2 km front and broke through the first line of trenches here they fought hand to hand and bayonet to bayonet with little advantage to either side outnumbering the s almost 5 to 1 the s drove the s back across the vit was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet which killed his horse beneath him making a brief stand the s eventually found themselves driven back into the city losing 5 000 men to the s 2 000 the next day osman surrendered the city the garrison and his sword to the n colonel he was treated honorably but his troops perished in the snows by the thousand as they straggled off into captivity the more seriously wounded were left behind in their camp hospitals only to be murdered by the s at this point having finally secured monetary aid from declared war on the again this time there were far fewer officers in the n army but this was more than offset by the experience gained from the 1876 1877 war under nominal command of effective command was in hands of general the army chief of staff the n army went on offensive in what is now eastern south a planned offensive into the was called off due to strong diplomatic pressure from which wanted to prevent and from coming into contact and which had designs to spread s influence through the area the s outnumbered unlike two years before mostly confined themselves to passive defence of fortified positions by the end of hostilities the serbs had liberated ak-palanka today and s under succeeded in capturing the passes at the mountain which were crucial for maneuvering next both sides fought a series of battles for gourko made several attacks on the and eventually secured it troops spent much effort to recapture this important route to use it to reinforce in but failed eventually gourko led a final offensive that crushed the s around the offensive against is considered one of the major mistakes of the war as other passes were virtually unguarded at this time a huge number of troops stayed fortified along the coast and engaged in very few operations besides the n army which mobilized 130 000 men losing 10 000 of them to this war a strong contingent and more than 12 000 volunteer troops opalchenie from the local population as well as many detachments fought in the war on the side

psychosocial developments cognitive development according to there are four major stages of cognitive development sensorimotor this stage occurs between the ages of birth and two years of age intelligence is demonstrated through motor activity with limited use of symbols including the infant s knowledge of the world is primarily based on physical s and experiences preoperational the second stage occurs between the ages of 2 7 years intelligence is increasingly demonstrated through the use of symbols and are developed as use matures the typical thought process is nonlogical nonreversible and concrete operations this developmental state occurs between ages 7 and 12 approximate during this stage characterized by conservation of number length liquid mass weight area and volume intelligence is increasingly demonstrated through logical and systematic manipulation of symbols relating to concrete objects thinking becomes operational reversible and less formal operations this final stage of cognitive development takes place from ages 12 and beyond during this stage intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts thinking becomes abstract hypothetical and early on it is believed that the majority of people never complete this stage emotional development emotional development concerns the child s increasing awareness and

preceding period the inhabitants of the isles had been nomadic but around 4000 new ideas arrived in the islands from continental europe these ideas were soon adopted by the natives leading to a radical transformation of society and landscape that has been called the revolution the period in the isles was characterised by the adoption of and sedentary living leading to the gradual decline of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to make room for the new farmland these early agricultural communities undertook mass across the islands dramatically and permanently transforming the landscape at the same time new types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced new technologies included polishing the also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape many of which were in nature the earliest of these are the of the early although in the late this form of monumentalization was replaced by the construction of a trend that would continue into the following these constructions are taken to reflect ideological changes with new ideas about religion ritual and social hierarchy and people were not literate leaving behind no written record that modern historians can study and all that is known about this time period comes from investigations this investigation began amongst the of the 18th century intensified in the 19th when coined the term in the 20th and 21st centuries further excavation and synthesis went ahead dominated by figures like and 1 1 late 1 2 early and middle 4000-2900 1 2 1 the spread of the 1 2 2 the in the isles 1 3 late 3000-2500 1 4 early 4 antiquarian and investigation historical overview the period is one of remarkable changes in landscapes societies and technologies which changed a wild forested world to one of orderly agricultural production and settled communities on the brink of socially complex civilisation it was a period that saw the arrival of new ideas and domesticated plants and animals perhaps new communities and the transformation of the native peoples of britain the opened an entirely new episode in human history it took place in britain over a relatively short space of time lasting in total only about 2000 years in human terms little more than 80-100 generations archaeologist and prehistorian on the in britain 2001 late the period that preceded the in the isles is known by archaeologists as the during this period britain was still attached by the landmass of to the rest of continental europe archaeologist and prehistorian noted that during the late the isles were something of a technological backwater in european terms still living as a hunter-gatherer society whilst most of southern europe had already taken up and sedentary living early and middle 4000-2900 the spread of the the first societies in the world to abandon hunter-gathering and replace it with were found in the near east and china around 8000-6000 although similar developments later occurred independently in mesoamerica south east asia africa and india it was in the near east that the most important developments in early occurred in the levant and the mountains surrounding what is now syria israel jordan turkey iran and iraq areas which already had rich ecological variation that was being exploited by in the late palaeolithic and periods early signs of these beginning to harvest manipulate and grow various food plants have been identified in the of the levant showing signs that would later lead to the actual domestication and of crops archaeologists believe that the levantine peoples subsequently developed between 8000 and 7000 in response to a rise in their population levels which could not be fed by the finite food resources that hunting and gathering could provide the idea of subsequently spread from the levant into europe being adopted by hunter-gathering societies in what is now turkey greece the balkans and across the merranean eventually reaching north-western europe and the isles the in the isles the community still debate whether the revolution was brought to the isles through adoption by natives or by migrating groups of continental europeans who settled there late 3000-2500 after over a thousand years of early a way of life based on ancestral tombs forest clearance and settlement expansion came to an end this was a time of important social changes archaeologist and prehistorian on the late in britain 2005 early the period that followed the is known by archaeologists as the and it is characterised by the adoption of as a material for making certain tools characteristics agriculture the is largely categorised by the introduction of into britain from continental europe from where it had come originally from the prior to this during the palaeolithic and periods the island s inhabitants had been and the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural one did not occur all at once there is also some evidence of different agricultural and hunter-gatherer groups within the isles meeting and trading with one another in the early part of the with some hunter-gatherer sites showing evidence of more complex technologies although it is known that the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural society was gradual it is still not fully understood and as archaeologist noted there is no doubt that domesticated animals and plants had to be carried by boat from the continent of europe to the isles there are a number of options groups of pioneers could have set off from the continent in one-off small-scale invasions or people might have arrived after a long-term and eclectic mixture of contacts down the continental coast from denmark to france or gatherer-hunters might have traveled by boat to the continent and brought back the animals and plants as the result of slowly developing exchange contacts there is no answer to this puzzle which is all the more intriguing since the earliest evidence for in the isles comes from ireland and probably the isle of man and not from southern britain the reason for switching from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural lifestyle has been widely debated by archaeologists and anthropologists ethnographic studies of societies who use basic stone tools and crops have shown that it is a much more labour intensive way of life than that of it would have involved deforesting an area digging and tilling the soil storing seeds and then guarding the growing crops from other animal species before eventually harvesting them in the cases of grains the crop produced then has to be processed to make it edible including grinding milling and cooking all of this involves far more preparation and work than either hunting or gathering deforestation the inside of the houses constructed on in northern scotland the agriculturalists areas of woodland in the isles in order to use the cleared land for notable examples of forest clearance occurred around 5000 in broome heath in on the and also on such clearances were performed not only with the use of stone but also through and burning with the latter two likely having been more effective nonetheless in many areas the forests had regrown within a few centuries including at ballysculion ballynagilly and the between 4300 and 3250 there was a widespread decline in the number of across britain with millions of them disappearing from the record and archaeologists have in some cases attributed this to the arrival of farmers for instance it has been suggested that farmers collected all the elm leaves to use as animal fodder during the winter and that the trees died after being debarked by domesticated nonetheless as pearson highlighted this decline in elm might be due to the a parasitic insect that carries with it and evidence for which has been found at west heath spa in it is possible that the spread of these beetles was coincidental although the hypothesis has also been suggested that farmers intentionally spread the beetles so that they destroyed the elm forests providing more land for meanwhile during the period from around 3500 to 3300 many of these areas began to see reforestation and mass tree regrowth indicating that human activity had retreated from these areas settlement around the period between 3500 to 3300 agricultural communities had begun centring themselves upon the most productive areas where the soils were more fertile namely around the eastern scotland the upper and the river valleys of the these areas saw an intensification of agricultural production and larger settlements the houses of the isles were typically rectangular being made out of wood and as such none survive to this day nonetheless foundations of such buildings have been found in the record although they are rare and have usually only been uncovered when they were in the vicinity of the more substantial stone monuments monumental architecture chambered tombs the chambered tomb of in ireland originally constructed circa 3200 but later reconstructed in the 1970s the early and the middle also saw the construction of large tombs across the isles because they housed the bodies of the dead these tombs have typically been considered by archaeologists to be a possible indication of by those who constructed them such tombs are common across much of western europe from to and they were therefore likely brought to the isles along with or roughly concurrent to the introduction of a widely held theory amongst archaeologists is that these tombs were intentionally made to resemble the long timber houses which had been constructed by peoples in the basin from circa 4800 as the historian related there is no doubt that these great tombs far more impressive than would be required of mere repositories for bones were the centres of ritual activity in the early they were shrines as well as mausoleums for some reason the success of and the veneration of ancestral and more recent bones had become bound up together in the minds of the people although there is disputed indicating that the chambered tomb at in ireland dates to circa 5000 the majority of such monuments in the isles appear to have been built between 4000 and 3200 a time period that archaeologist notes means that tomb building was a relatively short-lived fashion in terms amongst the most notable of these are those clustered around the complex in western ireland these include and the former of which was built between 3100 and 2900 stone circles main article stone circles in the isles and brittany the ring of brodgar a stone circle on northern scotland the late also saw the construction of society and culture stone technology axe about 31 cm in length the stone technology of the differed from that of and palaeolithic britain whereas hunter-gatherer tools were small sharp shards of agriculturalists used larger lithic tools typically these included made out of either or hard hafted onto wooden handles while some of these were evidently used for chopping wood and other practical purposes there are some axe heads from the period that appear never to have been used some too fragile to have been used in any case these latter likely had a decorative or ceremonial function settlement britons were capable of building a variety of different wooden constructions for instance in the then-marshland of the in south-western britain a wooden trackway was built in the winter of 3807 that connected the with westhay mears a length which ran for over a kilometre diet being agriculturalists the peoples of the isles grew grains such as and and these therefore played a part in their diet nonetheless this was supplemented at times with wild un-domesticated plant foods such as there is also evidence that had been consumed in based upon charred pips found at the site of hambledon hill these may have been imported from continental europe or they might have been grown on soil as the climate was warmer than that of the early 21st century hierarchy the fact that in the late various monuments were constructed that would have taken a large workforce a long time to produce has led many archaeologists to speculate that there must have been some sort of hierarchy organising such production religion as archaeologist john c barrett noted there never was a single body of beliefs which characterise neolithic religion the variety of practices attested by the various monuments cannot be explained as the expression of a single underlying cultural idea antiquarian and investigation 17th and 18th centuries the and are those responsible for initiating modern study of monuments like and it was in the 17th century ce that scholarly investigation into the surviving monuments first began in the isles although at the time these scholars had no understanding of prehistory instead relying on which implied that the earth itself was only around 5000 years old the first to do so was the antiquary and writer 1626-1697 who had been born into a wealthy gentry family before going on to study at till his education was disrupted by the outbreak of the between royalist and parliamentarian forces he recorded his accounts of these monuments in a book entitled the monumenta britannica but it remained unpublished nonetheless aubrey s work was picked up by another in the following century 1687-1765 who had studied at before becoming a professional doctor 19th century archaeologist sir was the first to coin the term in 1865 the term was first coined by the archaeologist 1st baron in his 1865 book pre-historic times as illustrated by ancient remains and the manners and customs of modern savages he used it to refer to the final stage of the defining this period purely on the technology of the time when humans had begun using polished stone tools but not yet started making metal tools lubbock s terminology was adopted by other archaeologists but as they gained a greater understanding of later prehistory it came to cover a wider set of characteristics by the 20th century when figures like were working on the the term had been broadened to include sedentary village life stock rearing and ceramics all assumed characteristic of immigrant agriculturalists 20th and 21st centuries in the 1960s a number of and american archaeologists began taking a new approach to their discipline by emphasising their belief that through the rigorous use of the they could obtain objective knowledge about the human past in ng so they forged the theoretical school of these processual archaeologists took a particular interest in the ecological impact on human society and in ng so the definition of was narrowed again to refer just to the agricultural mode of subsistence in the late 1980s processualism began to come under increasing criticism by a new wave of archaeologists who believed in the innate subjectivity of the discipline these figures forged the new theoretical school of post and a number of post-processualists turned their attention to the isles they interpreted the as an ideological phenomenon that was adopted by and society and led to them creating new forms of material-culture such as the funerary and ceremonial monuments references footnotes p 37-38 p 11 p 18 p 20 pp 20-21 p 22 p 57 p 17-19 pp 13-14 p 18 pp

the chairman of the bar announced in april 2008 that as a result of a survey of the profession the bar would recommend that advocates should retain their existing formal robes including wigs in all cases civil and criminal with possible exceptions in the county court in a letter to the profession he said in part criminal will keep wigs and as the intends to keep the current court dress in criminal proceedings the bar is a single advocacy profession with specialisation in particular practice areas there is logic in having the same formal court dress where formality and robes are required for criminal and civil there is strong identification of the bar of england and wales in the public s mind and its formal dress nationally and internationally new robes for judges were designed by and unveiled in may 2008 although a survey of judges published in march 2009 revealed substantial opposition to the new designs as well as widespread annoyance at the lack of consultation

white bow ties instead of qcs and judges wear long scarf-like ties known as falls instead of scottish judicial robes are very different from english ones are scotland s senior judges they sit in both the scotland s top civil court and the of justiciary scotland s top criminal court judicial robes in the are dark red faced with red crosses judicial robes in the of justiciary are predominatly white

robes and and with such wigs as have heretofore been worn by senior and junior counsel respectively and no counsel shall be heard in any case during the sittings unless so habited while the

date all counsel still must wear a gown and etc by affording individual a discretion to wear the forensic wig in court the new rule de what had become an increasingly bitter debate in the profession whether it was appropriate to cleave to anachronistic modes of dress even as a traditional and undoubtedly recognizable and avoided a more drastic solution such as the aonment of wigs or altogether accordingly there is little contemporary call for reform of court dress in ireland call to the bar junior counsel are in three sittings in the year one in one and the other in this ceremony takes place in the all new habit themselves in full court working dress call to the inner bar are appointed annually in the call to the inner bar a short ceremony in the towards the end of junior counsel

of generating 1 21 of energy is a bolt of lightning discovering the save the clock tower flyer that marty received in 1985 indicating that lightning will strike the courthouse clock tower the following saturday at 10 04 pm doc makes plans to harness the lightning strike to power the delorean s when they observe a fading photograph of marty with his siblings they realize marty has prevented

the mcfly family as marty reunites with doc arrives insisting they accompany him to the future to sort out a problem with their future children marty and enter the upgraded delorean now a powered by and doc flies the into the future development writing writer and producer conceived the idea after he visited his parents in after the release of searching their basement gale found his father s high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class gale thought about the president of his own graduating class who was someone he had nothing to do with gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together when he returned to he told his new concept zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when in reality she was highly promiscuous the two took the project to and made a development deal for a script in september 1980 zemeckis and gale set the story in 1955 because they claimed mathematically a 17-year-old traveling to meet his parents at the same age meant traveling to that decade the era also marked the rise of teenagers as an important cultural element the birth of rock n roll and suburb expansion which would flavor the story originally the was a refrigerator and he needed to use the power of an atomic explosion at the to return home zemeckis was concerned that kids would accidentally lock themselves in refrigerators and found that it would be more convenient if the were mobile the delorean was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a believable in addition the original climax was deemed too expensive by the executives of universal and was simplified spielberg later used the omitted refrigerator and nevada nuclear site elements in his film the writers found it difficult to create a believable friendship between marty and brown before they created the giant guitar amplifier and only resolved his relationship with his mother when they wrote the line it s like i m kissing my brother was named after universal executive who behaved aggressively toward zemeckis and gale during a script meeting for the first draft of was finished in february 1981 put the film in they thought it was a really nice cute warm film but not sexual enough gale said they suggested that we take it to but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us every rejected the script for the next four years while went through two more drafts during the early 1980s popular teen comedies such as and were risque and adult-aimed so the script was commonly rejected for being too light gale and zemeckis finally decided to pitch to they told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a under the banner gale said the two were tempted to ally themselves with who produced and which both flopped spielberg was initially absent from the project because zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him he would never be able to make another film gale said we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were two guys who could only get a job because we were pals with one producer was interested but changed his mind when he learned spielberg was not involved zemeckis chose to direct instead which was a box office success now a high-profile director zemeckis approached spielberg with the concept and the project was set up at executive made some suggestions to the script changing marty s mother s name from meg to lorraine the name of his wife actress to change brown s name from professor brown to and replace his pet chimpanzee with a dog sheinberg also wanted the title changed to spaceman from convinced no successful film ever had future in the title he suggested marty introduce himself as from the planet while dressed as an alien forcing his dad to ask out his mom rather than the planet and that the farmer s son s comic book be titled spaceman from rather than space zombies from appalled by the new title that sheinberg wanted to impose zemeckis asked spielberg for help spielberg subsequently dictated a back to sheinberg wherein spielberg convinced him they thought his title was just a joke thus embarrassing him into dropping the idea casting see also a photo of the first time travel test with as was the first choice to play but he was committed to the show producer felt that fox was essential to the show s success with co-star merh baxter on he refused to allow fox time off to work on a film was originally scheduled for a may 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that fox would be unable to star in the film zemeckis next two choices were and the latter of whom impressed the producers enough with his portrayal of roy l dennis in which had yet to be released that they selected him to play because of the difficult casting process the start date was pushed back twice four weeks into filming zemeckis determined stoltz had been miscast although he and spielberg realized reshooting the film would add 3 million to the 14 million budget they decided to recast spielberg explained zemeckis felt stoltz was too humorless and gave a terrifically dramatic performance gale further explained they felt stoltz was simply acting out the role whereas fox himself had a personality like he felt stoltz was uncomfortable riding a skateboard whereas fox was not stoltz confessed to director during a phone call two weeks into the shoot that he was unsure of zemeckis and gale s direction and concurred that he was wrong for the role fox s schedule was opened up in january 1985 when merh baxter returned to following her pregnancy the crew met with goldberg again who made a deal that fox s main priority would be and if a scheduling conflict arose we win fox loved the script and was impressed by zemeckis and gale s sensitivity in releasing stoltz because they nevertheless spoke very highly of him and bob schmelzer assisted on the skateboarding scenes fox found his portrayal of to be very personal all i did in high school was skateboard chase girls and play in bands i even dreamed of becoming a rock star was cast as after the first choice became unavailable having worked with lloyd on 1984 producer suggested him for the part lloyd originally turned down the role but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife he some of his scenes taking inspiration from and conductor brown mispronounces as jigawatts which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with zemeckis and gale as they reed the script played zemeckis said glover much of george s nerdy mannerisms such as his shaky hands the director joked he was endlessly throwing a net over crispin because he was completely off about fifty percent of the time in his interpretation of the character due to a contract disagreement glover was replaced by in and part was cast as because she had acted opposite stoltz in her for scenes at the beginning of the film set in 1985 took three-and-a-half hours to apply was cast as because the producers felt that the original choice wasn t physically imposing enough to bully stoltz cohen was recast as one of biff s cohorts had fox been cast from the beginning cohen probably would have won the part because he was sufficiently taller than fox conversely was originally cast in the role of marty s girlfriend but was let go after was dismissed with the explanation that the actress was now too tall to be playing against hardin was dismissed before she had a chance to shoot a single scene and was replaced with actress had also been considered to play marty s girlfriend production as it appeared in following stoltz s departure fox s schedule during weekdays consisted of filming during the day and from 6 30 pm to 2 30 am he averaged five hours of sleep each night during fridays he shot from 10 pm to 6 or 7 am and then moved on to film exterior scenes throughout the weekend as only then was he available during daytime hours fox found it exhausting but it was my dream to be in the film and television business although i didn t know i d be in them simultaneously it was just this weird ride and i got on zemeckis concurred dubbing the film that would not wrap he recalled that because they shot night after night he was always half asleep and the fattest most out-of-shape and sick i ever was lyon estates set used in the film the town square scenes were shot at located in the universal studios back lot explained it would have been impossible to shoot on location because no city is going to let a film crew remodel their town to look like it s in the 1950s the filmmakers decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful then we would just totally trash it down and make it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes the interiors for s house were shot at the while exteriors took place at the exterior shots of the twin pines mall and later the lone pine mall from 1985 were shot at the in city of industry the exterior shots and some interior scenes at high school were filmed at in whittier while the band tryouts and the enchantment under the sea dance were filmed in the gymnasium at the scenes outside of the baines house in the 50s were shot at bushnell avenue filming wrapped after 100 days on april 20 1985 and the film was delayed from may to august but after a highly positive test screening i d never seen a preview like that said the audience went up to the ceiling sheinberg chose to move the release date to july 3 to make sure the film met this new date two ors and were assigned to the picture while many sound ors worked 24-hour shifts on the film eight minutes were cut including marty watching his mom cheat during an exam george getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing lorraine as well as much of marty pretending to be zemeckis almost cut out the sequence as he felt it did not advance the story but the preview audience loved it so it was kept created the film s 32 effects shots which did not satisfy zemeckis and gale until a week before the film s completion date music see also collaborated with zemeckis on but spielberg disliked that film s score zemeckis advised silvestri to make his compositions grand and epic despite

from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to by moritz daniel oppenheim on his 90th birthday 10 august 1884 יום טוב ליפמן צונץ yom tov lipmann tzuntz 10 august 1794 17 march 1886 was a and writer the founder of what has been termed jewish studies or judaic studies the investigation of hymnology and ritual zunz s historical investigations and contemporary writings had an important influence on contemporary judaism biography was born at and settled in in 1815 studying at the university of and obtaining a from the he was by the early and served for two years teaching and giving sermons in the reform new synagogue in he found the career uncongenial and in 1840 he was appointed director of a lehrerseminar a post which relieved him from pecuniary troubles zunz was always interested in politics and in 1848 addressed many public meetings in 1850 he resigned his headship of the teachers seminary and was awarded a pension throughout his early and married life he was the champion of jewish rights and he did not withdraw from public affairs until 1874 the year of the death of his wife adelheid beermann whom he had married in 1822 together with other young men among them the poet zunz founded the verein fur kultur und wissenschaft der juden alongside and in in 1819 in 1823 zunz became the or of the zeitschrift fur die wissenschaft des judenthums journal for the science of judaism the ideals of this verein were not destined to bear religious fruit but the science of judaism survived zunz took no large share in but never lost faith in the regenerating power of as applied to the traditions and literary legacies of the ages he influenced judaism from the study rather than although affiliated with the reform movement zunz appeared to show little sympathy for it though this has been attributed to his disdain for ecclesiastical ambition and fears that nical autocracy would result from the reform crusade further isidore singer and emil hirsch have stated that the point of geiger s protest against reform was directed against and the position maintained by this leader as an autonomous later in life zunz went so far as to refer to s as soothsayers and quacks the violent outcry raised against the talmud by some of the principal spirits of the reform party was repugnant to zunz s historic sense zunz himself was temperamentally inclined to assign a determinative potency to sentiment this explaining his tender reverence for ceremonial usages although zunz kept to the jewish ritual practises he understood them as symbols see among others his mation on tefillin reprinted in gesammelte schriften ii 172-176 this contrasts with the traditional view of the validity of divine ordinances according to which the faithful are bound to observe without inquiry into their meaning his position accordingly approached that of the symbolists among the reformers who insisted that symbols had their function provided their suggestive significance was spontaneously comprehensible he emphasized most strongly the need of a moral regeneration of the jews he wrote precise philological studies but also impassioned speeches on the jewish nation and history that had an influence on later jewish historians zunz wrote in 1855 if there are ranks in suffering israel takes precedence of all the nations if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they are borne ennoble the jews can challenge the aristocracy of every land if a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic tragedies what shall we say to a national tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes in 1840 he became director of the jewish teachers seminary he was friendly with the traditional enlightenment figure whose moreh nebuke ha-zeman lemberg 1851 was ed according to the author s last will by his friend zunz died in in 1886 works in 1832 appeared the most important jewish book published in the 19th century this was zunz s gottesdienstliche vortrage der juden i e a history of the it lays down principles for the investigation of the rabbinic exegesis and of the prayer-book of the synagogue this book raised zunz to the supreme position among jewish scholars in 1845 appeared his zur geschichte und literatur in which he threw light on the literary and social history of the jews he had visited the in 1846 and this confirmed him in his plan for his third book synagogale poesie des mittelalters 1855 it was from this book that translated the following opening of a chapter of daniel deronda if there are ranks in suffering israel takes precedence of all the nations after its publication zunz again visited england and in 1859 issued his in this he gives a masterly survey of synagogal rites his last great book was his literaturgeschichte der synagogalen poesie 1865 a supplement appeared in 1867 besides these works zunz published a new translation of the and wrote many essays which were afterwards collected

the first republican president in 1860 seven states declared their and formed the before lincoln was inaugurated the government both outgoing and incoming refused to recognize the and when the new confederate davis ordered his troops to open fire on in april 1861 there was an overwhelming demand north and south for war only the state of attempted to remain neutral and it could only do so briefly when lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion four more states decided to secede and join the which then moved its capital to although the had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers it was slower than the in dealing with the by march 1862 the largely controlled and had shut down all commercial traffic from all confederate ports had prevented european recognition of the confederate government and was poised to seize confederate dead of general ewell s corps who attacked the lines at the battle of spotsylvania may 19 1864 in the four years of war 1861 65 the south was the primary battleground with all but two of the major battles taking place on southern soil forces relentlessly squeezed the controlling the in 1861 the river the cumberland river and in 1862 and the river in 1863 in the however the rebel army under beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at but when lee tried to move north he was repulsed and nearly captured at antietam 1862 and gettysburg 1863 the had the resources for a short war but was unable to finance or supply a longer war it reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the south by imposing a new 15 tax on all imports from the the blockade stopped most commerce from entering the south and smugglers avoided the tax so the confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war inflated currency was the solution but that created distrust of the government because of low investment in railroads the southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat both were shut down by the the small railroad system virtually collapsed so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the confederate economy was crippled the confederate cause was hopeless by the time fell and marched through in late 1864 but the rebels fought on refusing to give up their independence until lee s army was captured in april 1865 all the confederate forces surrendered and there was no insurgency as the moved into the the south suffered much more than the north overall as the strategy of attrition meant that lee could not replace his casualties and the total war waged by sherman sheridan and other armies devastated the and caused widespread poverty and distress the suffered military losses of 95 000 men killed in action and 165 000 who died of disease for a total of 260 000 out of a total white southern population at the time of around 5 5 million based on 1860 census figures 8 of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war including 6 in the north and about 18 in the south northern military casualties exceeded southern casualties in absolute numbers but were two-thirds smaller in terms of proportion of the population affected reconstruction and main articles of the disfranchisement after and voting rights in the after the the south was devastated in terms of population and economy because of states reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen instituted reconstruction governments it established military districts and governors to rule over the south until new governments could be established many white southerners who had actively supported the were temporarily disfranchised rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression in addition what limited the south had was mostly destroyed by the war at the same time the north was rapidly industrializing to avoid the social effects of the war most of the initially passed eventually these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-confederate legistures which persisted for a short time during reconstruction a home on the 1871 there were thousands of people on the move as tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states other freedpeople moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs and out from under white control at the same time whites returned from refuges to reclaim or town dwellings in some areas many whites returned to the land to farm for a while some freedpeople left the south altogether for states such as and na and later kansas thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the and delta bottomlands and with passage of the to the of the which outlawed slavery the which granted full u s citizenship to and the which extended the right to vote to males in the south were made free citizens and were given the right to vote under federal protection white and black republicans formed constitutional conventions and state governments among their accomplishments was creating the first public education systems in and providing for welfare through orphanages hospitals and similar institutions northerners came south to participate in politics and business some were representatives of the freedmen s bureau and other agencies of reconstruction some were humanitarians with the intent to help black people also as is often the case in volatile environments some were adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods they were all condemned with the pejorative term of carpetbagger some southerners also took advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various schemes including bonds and financing for railroads secret organizations such as the an organization sworn to perpetuate had arisen quickly after the war s end and used physical attacks house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep from exercising their political rights although the first klan was disrupted by prosecution by the federal government in the early 1870s other groups persisted by the mid-to-late-1870s elite white southerners created increasing resistance to the altered social structure such as the in 1874 the in 1875 and rifle clubs all white line organizations used organized violence against republicans blacks and whites to turn republicans out of office repress and bar black voting and restore democrats to power in 1876 white democrats regained power in most of the state legislatures they began to pass laws designed to strip and poor whites from the voter registration rolls the success of late-19th century interracial coalitions in several states inspired a reaction among some white democrats who worked harder to prevent both groups from voting despite discrimination many blacks became property owners in areas that were still developing for instance 90 of the s bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war by the end of the century two-thirds of the farmers in s delta bottomlands were black they had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber tens of thousands of migrants went to the delta both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies and many to develop their own farms child laborers bluffton 1913 nearly all southerners black and white suffered as a result of the within a few years production and harvest was back to pre-war levels but low prices through much of the 19th century hampered recovery they encouraged immigration by and laborers into the delta while the first entered as indentured laborers from cuba the majority came in the early-20th century neither group stayed long at rural farm labor the became merchants and established stores in small towns throughout the delta establishing a place between white and black migrations continued in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among both blacks and whites in the last two decades oth the 19th century about 141 000 blacks left the south and more after 1900 totaling a loss of 537 000 after that the movement increased in what became known as the from 1910 1940 and the second through 1970 even more whites left the south some going to california for opportunities and others heading to northern industrial cities after 1900 between 1880 and 1910 the loss of whites totaled 1 243 000 five million more left between 1940 and 1970 from 1890 to 1908 10 of the 11 states passed constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barriars such as residency requirements and that were hard for many poor to meet most mexican and tens of thousands of poor whites were disfranchised losing the vote for decades in some states temporarily exempted white illiterates from the numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the south as a result this can be seen on the feature turnout in ial and midterm at the university of barriers to voting which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 when it became a state also substantially reduced voting by poor whites legislatures passed to segregate public facilities and services including transportation while poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early-20th century for decades decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting most blacks in the south could not vote until 1965 after passage of the voting rights t and federal enforcement to ensure people could register not until the late 1960s did all american citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the late 19th and 20th century industrialization and main article at the end of the 19th century white democrats in the south had created state constitutions that were hostile to industry and business development was limited as was access to cr persisted in agricultural economies as in rural minorities held control in many state legislatures

expansion after the in the early 20th century invasion of the devastated crops in states of the south this was an additional catalyst to decisions to leave the south from 1910 to 1940 and then from the 1940s to 1970 more than 6 5 million left the south in the to northern and midwestern cities making multiple acts of resistance against persistent and violence poor education and inability to vote their movements transformed many cities creating new cultures and music in the north many like other groups became industrial workers others started their own businesses within the communities

c 140 ad this included 10 epistles from st as well as a version of the of which today is known as the of marcion in so doing he established a particular way of looking at religious texts that persists in ian thought today after marcion ians began to divide texts into those that aligned well with the canon of accepted theological thought and those that promoted heresy this played a major role in finalizing the structure of the collection of works called the it has been proposed that the initial impetus for the proto-orthodox ian project of canonization flowed from opposition to the canonization of marcion apostolic s a four-gospel canon the tetramorph was asserted by in the following quote it is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are for since there are four quarters of the earth in which we live and four universal winds while the church is scattered throughout all the world and the pillar and ground of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life it is fitting that she should have four pillars breathing out immortality on every side and vivifying men afresh therefore the gospels are in accord with these things for the living creatures are quadriform and the gospel is quadriform these things being so all who destroy the form of the gospel are vain unlearned and also audacious those i mean who represent the aspects of the gospel as being either more in number than as aforesaid or on the other hand fewer a folio from an early 3rd century collection of by the early 3rd century ian theologians like may have been using or at least were familiar with the same 27 found in ions though there were still disputes over the canonicity of some of the writings see also likewise by 200 the shows that there existed a set of ian writings somewhat similar to what is now the which included four gospels and argued against objections to them thus while there was a good measure of debate in the over the the major writings were accepted by almost all ians by the middle of the 3rd century alexandrian s was an early figure in the codification of the canon he was a scholar well educated in the realm of both and pagan

rejected the religious scholar described origen s efforts saying the process of canonization represented by origen proceeded by way of selection moving from many candidates for inclusion to fewer this was one of the first major attempts at the compilation of certain and letters as authoritative and inspired teaching for the at the time although it is unclear whether origen intended for his to be authoritative itself in his er letter of 367 bishop of alexandria gave a of exactly the same that would become the 27 book proto-canon and he used the phrase being canonized kanonizomena in regard to them also included the as well as the in his however from this canon he omitted the book of canons the eastern churches had in general a weaker feeling than those in the west for the necessity of making a sharp delineation with regard to the canon it was more conscious of the gradation of spiritual quality among the that it accepted e g the classification of eusebius see also and was less often disposed to assert that the which it rejected possessed no spiritual quality at all for example the which was rejected by pope see also endorsed the following s of canonical writings the c 385 the synod of laodicea c 363 the third synod of carthage c 397 and the 39th festal letter of 367 and yet these s do not agree similarly the s of the national churches of egypt the coptic and all have minor differences the is one of the most uncertain it was not translated into n until the 10th century and it has never been included in the official of the whether or ern latin s the first council that accepted the present canon the may have been the in north africa 393 the acts of this council however are lost a brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the in 397 and 419 these councils were under the authority of who regarded the canon as already closed s in 382 if the is correctly associated with it issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above or if not the is at least a 6th century compilation likewise damasus commissioning of the latin ion of the c 383 was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the in 405 sent a of the sacred to a gallic bishop when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter however they were not defining something new but instead were ratifying what had already become the mind of the thus from the 4th century there existed unanimity in the concerning the as it is today and by the 5th century the with a few exceptions had come to accept the and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the a on display main article 1483 1546 made an attempt to remove the of and from the canon echoing the consensus of several s also labeled ian humanists such as and and partially because they were perceived to go against certain doctrines such as and but this was not generally accepted among his followers however these are ordered last in the to this day in addition luther moved the that later became the icals into a section he called the canon accept the original texts in and aramaic as the inspired rather than the translation into though many recognize the latter s wide use by speaking in the 1st century they note that early ians evidenced a knowledge of a canon of scripture based upon internal evidence as well as by the existence of a of by compiled around ad see many s point to the following four criteria for canonicity to justify the selection of the that have been included in the though these ideas aren t isolated to but extend to or are derived from other ian s apostolic origin attributed to and based upon the preaching teaching of the first-generation apostles or their close companions universal acceptance acknowledged by all major ian communities in the ancient world by the end of the 4th century as well as accepted canon by authorities for the liturgical use read publicly when early ian communities gathered for the lord s supper their weekly worship services consistent message containing a theological outlook similar to or complementary to other accepted ian writings the basic factor for recognizing a book s canonicity for the was divine inspiration and the chief test for this was apostolicity the term apostolic as used for the test of canonicity does not necessarily mean apostolic or derivation but rather apostolic authority according to these s apostolic authority is never detached from the authority of the lord see it is sometimes difficult to apply these criteria to all of the in the accepted canon however and one can point to writings that s consider to be un which would fulfill these requirements in practice most s and all hold to the canon for the and the canon for the canons of various ian s full dogmatic articulations of the canons were not made until the of 1546 for the thirty-nine icles of 1563 for the of england the minster confession of of 1647 for and the synod of of 1672 for the other s while also having closed canons may not be able to point to the exact years in which their respective canons were considered to be complete the following tables reflect the current state of various ian canons main article of the all of the major ian s accept the of the in its entirety as divinely inspired and authoritative furthermore all of these s with the exception of the s add to this number various deuterocanonical however in some s especially the english and the many of these deuterocanonical are retained as part of the in a section called the some ed here like the for the n apostolic may have once been a vital part of a may even still hold a place of honor but are no longer considered to be part of the other like the of manasseh for the may have been included in but never really attained a high level of importance within that particular the levels of al prominence for others like and the of of the c churches remain unclear in so far as the n canon is concerned some points of clarity should be made first the of and as well as the and

baronial style common features borrowed from 16th and 17th century houses included gateways pointed and the style was popular across and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as 1789 1870 1803 76 1787 1879 c 1847 1914 and 1864 1929 and in urban contexts including the building of in edinburgh from the 1850s as well as the national at stirling 1859 69 the rebuilding of

designs for the new see right between 1821 and 1838 pugin and his father published a series of volumes of the first two entitled specimens of architecture and the following three examples of architecture that were to remain both in print and the standard references for revivalists for at least the next century in contrasts 1836 pugin expressed his admiration not only for art but for the whole ethos claiming that architecture is the product of a purer society in the true principles of pointed or christian architecture 1841 he suggested that modern craftsmen seeking to emulate the style of workmanship should also reproduce its methods pugin believed is true christian architecture and even claimed the pointed arch was produced by the catholic faith pugin s most famous project is in london his part in the design consisted of two campaigns 1836 1837 and again in 1844 and 1852 with the classicist as his nominal superior whether the pair worked as a collegial partnership or if barry acted as pugin s superior is not entirely clear pugin provided the external decoration and the interiors while barry designed the symmetrical layout of the building causing pugin to remark all grecian sir tudor details on a classic body ruskin and venetian main article venetian architecture supplemented pugin s ideas in his two hugely influential theoretical works 1849 and 1853 finding his architectural ideal in ruskin proposed that buildings excelled above all other architecture because of the sacrifice of the stone-carvers in intricately decorating every stone by declaring the to be the central building of the world ruskin argued the case for government buildings as pugin had done for churches though only in theory when his ideas were put into practice ruskin despised the spate of public buildings built with references to the ducal palace including the in and funerary style construction of began in 1907 and was completed in 1990 main article in the was undergoing a revival

ready exponents in the universities where the was forming its proponents believed that was the only style appropriate for a parish church and favoured a particular era of architecture the the camden society through its journal the ecclesiologist was so savagely critical of new church buildings that were below its exacting standards and its pronouncements were followed so avidly that it became the epicentre of the flood of that affected most of the anglican cathedrals and parish churches in and the development of the private was occurring at the same time as the movement sir pioneered the first cemetery in the style at in 1837 with chapels gates and decorative features in the manner attracting the interest of contemporary architects such as barry and the style was immediately hailed a success and universally replaced the previous preference for classical design however not every architect or client was swept away by this tide although revival succeeded in becoming an increasingly familiar style of architecture the attempt to associate it with the notion of high church superiority as advocated by pugin and the was anathema to those with ecumenical or nonconformist principles they looked to adopt it solely for its aesthetic romantic qualities to combine it with other styles or look to northern european brick for a more plain appearance or in some instances all three of these as at the non-denominational designed by in 1840 viollet-le-duc and iron if france had not been quite as early on the neo scene she produced a giant of the revival in as well as being a powerful and influential theorist viollet-le-duc was a leading architect whose genius lay in restoration he believed in restoring buildings to a state of completion that they would not have known even when they were first built theories he applied to his restorations of the walled city of and to and in paris in this respect he differed from his english counterpart ruskin as he often replaced the work of mediaeval stonemasons his rational approach to was in stark contrast to the revival s romanticist origins throughout his career he remained in a quandary as to whether iron and masonry should be combined in a building iron had in fact been used in buildings since the earliest days of the revival it was only with ruskin and the archaeological s demand for structural truth that iron whether it was visible or not was deemed improper for a building this argument began to collapse in the mid-19th century as great prefabricated structures such as the glass and iron and the glazed courtyard of the were erected which appeared to embody principles through iron between 1863 and 1872 viollet-le-duc published his entretiens sur l architecture a set of daring designs for buildings that combined iron and masonry though these projects were never realised they influenced several generations of designers and architects the notable ones being in spain and in viollet s foremost english follower

14 months following before being sworn in for his full term in january 1965 as a result it was widely assumed when began that johnson would be the nominee and that he would have little trouble in winning the nomination despite the growing opposition to johnson s policies in vietnam no prominent candidate was prepared to run against a sitting of his own party even of an outspoken critic of johnson s policies with a large base of support refused to run against johnson in the only of proved willing to openly challenge johnson running as an candidate in the mccarthy hoped to pressure the democrats into publicly opposing the vietnam war normally an incumbent president faces little formidable opposition within his own party however mccarthy although he was trailing badly in the national polls decided to pour most of his resources into the first state to hold a he was boosted by thousands of young college students who shaved their beards and cut their hair to be clean for gene these students rang doorbells and worked hard in for mccarthy on march 12 mccarthy won 42 of the primary vote to johnson s 49 an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger and one which gave mccarthy s legitimacy and momentum the momentum ended however when kennedy announced his candidacy four days later on march 16 as mccarthy supporters cried betrayal and vowed to defeat kennedy thereafter mccarthy and kennedy would engage in an increasingly bitter series of state although kennedy won most of the he could never shake mccarthy and his devoted following of antiwar activists which included many celebrities such as and johnson withdraws on march 31 following the and kennedy s entry into the election the startled the nation by announcing he would not seek re-election not discussed publicly at the time was johnson s concern that he might not survive another term johnson s health was poor and he had suffered a serious in 1955 johnson in fact died two days after the end of s first term bleak political forecasts also contributed to johnson s withdrawal internal polling by johnson s in the next state to hold a showed the trailing badly and in fact he lost the april 2 primary to mccarthy who won 56 of the vote to johnson s 35 with johnson s withdrawal the party quickly split into four factions each of which distrusted the other three the first faction comprised labor unions and big-city party bosses led by mayor this group had traditionally controlled the party since the days of and they feared their loss of control over the party after johnson s withdrawal this group rallied to support johnson s vice it was also believed that johnson himself was covertly supporting humphrey despite his public claims of neutrality the second faction which rallied behind mccarthy was composed of students and intellectuals who had been the early activists against the war in vietnam they perceived themselves as the future of the party the third group was primarily composed of and other racial and ethnic minorities these groups rallied behind the fourth group consisted of conservative white southern democrats or some members of this group probably older ones remembering the s positive impact upon rural areas supported vice humphrey but most of them would rally behind and the governor s third-party in the general election since the vietnam war had become the major issue that was dividing the party and johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal democrats johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle and that he would probably lose the election in november to the republicans however by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to humphrey who had been a loyal vice as the year developed it also became clear that johnson believed he could secure his place in the history books by ending the war before the election in november thus giving humphrey the boost he would need to win contest for the nomination after johnson s withdrawal announced his candidacy on april 27 kennedy was successful in four state and and mccarthy won six and however in where they ed directly against one another kennedy won three and and mccarthy won one humphrey did not compete in the leaving that job to who were his surrogates notably from from and of instead humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states where party leaders such as mayor controlled the delegate votes in their states kennedy defeated branigin and mccarthy in the primary and then defeated mccarthy in the primary however mccarthy upset kennedy in the primary after kennedy s defeat in the primary was seen as crucial to both kennedy and mccarthy mccarthy stumped the state s many colleges and universities where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war kennedy ed in the ghettos and of the state s larger cities where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters kennedy and mccarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the election it was generally considered a draw on june 4 kennedy narrowly defeated mccarthy in 46 to 42 however mccarthy refused to withdraw from the presidential race and made it clear that he would contest kennedy in the upcoming primary where mccarthy had much support from antiwar activists in city the primary quickly became a moot point however when in the early morning of june 5 shortly after his victories in the and he died twenty-six hours later kennedy had just given his victory speech in a crowded ballroom of the ambassador hotel in los angeles he and his aides squeezed into a kitchen on their way to another ballroom to celebrate their victory in the kitchen s pantry kennedy and five other people were shot a young who disliked kennedy for his support of the state of was arrested tried and convicted political historians have debated to this day whether kennedy could have won the nomination had he lived some historians such as and have argued that kennedy s broad appeal and famed would have convinced the party bosses at the to give him the nomination however other writers such as who covered the kennedy for the times believe that humphrey s large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states combined with mccarthy s refusal to quit the race would have prevented kennedy from ever winning a majority at the and that humphrey would have been the nominee even if kennedy had lived journalist has written that humphrey was the likely nominee and rfk s own manager future national committee chairman wrote in his memoirs that kennedy s chances of winning the nomination had been slim even after his win in at the moment

from the traditional power blocs of the party he was an unpopular choice with many of the elements within the party who identified him with johnson s controversial position on the vietnam war however kennedy s delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented humphrey from getting the nomination some of kennedy s support went to mccarthy but many of kennedy s delegates remembering their bitter primary battles with mccarthy refused to vote for him instead these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of of a kennedy supporter in the spring and who had presidential ambitions however by dividing the antiwar votes at the it made it easier for humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination when the national opened in thousands of young antiwar activists from around the nation gathered in the city to protest the vietnam war in a clash which was covered on live television americans were shocked to see police brutally beating

from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to a r radcliffe-brown alfred reginald radcliffe-brown born alfred reginald brown 17 january 1881 in died 24 october 1955 in was an who developed the theory of biography radcliffe-brown was born in after studying at he travelled to the 1906 1908 and 1910 1912 with biologist and writer and to conduct fieldwork into the workings of the societies there serving as the inspiration for his later books the andaman islanders 1922 and the social organization of australian tribes 1930 however at the 1914 meeting of the british association for the advancement of science in he was accused by bates of plagiarizing her work in 1916 he became a director of education in and in 1920 moved to to become professor of social anthropology founding the school of african life further university appointments were university of 1920 25 1925 31 and 1931 37 among his most prominent students during his years at the was and after these various far-flung appointments he finally returned to in 1937 to take up an appointment to the first chair in social anthropology at oxford in 1937 a post he held until his retirement in 1946 while he founded the institute of social and cultural anthropology at oxford according to his absence from the institute during the war years prevented his theories and approach from having a major influence on oxford anthropology work he has been described as the classic to s romantic radcliffe-brown brought french sociology namely to british anthropology constructing a rigorous battery of concepts to frame ethnography greatly influenced by the work of he saw institutions as the key to maintaining the global of a society analogous to the organs of a body and his studies of social function examine how customs aid in maintaining the overall stability of a society concept of function radcliffe-brown has often been associated with and is considered by some to be the founder of structural nonetheless radcliffe-brown vehemently denied being a functionalist and carefully distinguished his concept of function from that of malinowski who openly advocated while malinowski s claimed that social practices could be directly explained by their ability to satisfy basic biological needs radcliffe-brown rejected this as baseless instead influenced by the process philosophy of he claimed that the fundamental units of anthropology were processes of human life and interaction because these are by definition characterised by constant flux what calls for explanation is the occurrence of stability why radcliffe-brown asked would some patterns of social practices repeat themselves and even seem to become fixed he reasoned that this would at least require that other practices must not conflict with them too much and that in some cases it may be that practices grow to support each other a notion he called deriving from the biological term functional analysis then was just the attempt to explain stability by discovering how practices fit together to sustain that stability the function of a practice was just its role in sustaining the overall social structure insofar as there was a stable social structure radcliffe-brown 1957 this is far from the functional explanation later impugned by and others it is also clearly distinct from malinowski s notion of function a point which is often ignored by radcliffe-brown s detractors concept of social structure while 1958 claimed that social structure and the social relations that are its constituents are theoretical constructions used to model social life radcliffe-brown only half-agreed he argued 1957 that social relations are real and even directly observable but that social structure is a theoretical construction posited by the scientist on the basis of his or her observation of social relations he shared with the notion that a major goal of social anthropology was to identify social structures and formal relationships between them and that qualitative or would be a necessary tool to do this in that sense radcliffe-brown may be considered one of the fathers of in addition to identifying abstract relationships between social structures radcliffe-brown argued for the importance of the notion of a total social structure which is the sum total of social relations in a given of analysis during a given period the identification of functions of social practices was supposed to be relative to this total social structure levis strauss saw social structure as a model evolutionism and the role of social anthropology a popular view in the study of tribal societies had been that all societies follow a unilineal path and that therefore primitive societies could be understood as earlier stages along that path conversely modern societies contained vestiges of older forms another view was that social practices tend to develop only once and that therefore commonalities and differences between societies could be explained by a historical reconstruction of the interaction between societies according to both of these views the proper way to explain differences between tribal societies and modern ones was historical reconstruction radcliffe-brown rejected both of these views because of the untestable nature of historical reconstructions instead he argued for the use of the to find regularities in human societies and thereby build up a genuinely scientific knowledge of social life to that end radcliffe-brown argued for a natural science of society he claimed that there was an independent role for social anthropology here separate from psychology though not in conflict with it this was because psychology was to be the study of individual mental processes while social anthropology was to study processes of interaction between people social relations thus he argued for a principled ontological distinction between psychology and social anthropology in the same way as one might try to make a principled distinction between physics and biology moreover he claimed that existing social scientific disciplines with the possible exception of were arbitrary and did not have any principled reason to exist once our knowledge of society is sufficient he argued we will be able to form subdisciplines of anthropology centred around relatively isolated parts of the social structure but without extensive scientific knowledge it is impossible to know where these boundaries will be drawn ethnography radcliffe-brown carried out extensive fieldwork in the australia and elsewhere on the basis of this re he contributed extensively to the anthropological ideas on kinship and criticized s he also produced structural analyses of myths including on the basis of the concept of binary distinctions an idea later echoed by criticisms radcliffe-brown was often criticized for failing to consider the effect of historical changes in the societies he studied in particular changes brought about by colonialism but he is now considered together with as the father of modern social anthropology publication among radcliffe-brown s many works are 1922 the andaman islanders 1931 social

aqil siradj website jombang mosque birthplace of the nahdlatul ulama nahdlatul ulama also nahdatul ulama or nu is a traditionalist group in the nu was established on january 31 1926 as a reaction to the modernist organization in 1965 the group took sides with the led army and was heavily involved in of n communists however the nu later began to oppose s regime in 1984 the grandson of nu founder hasyim asy ari inherited the leadership from his father and was later elected president of in 1999 he formally apologized for nu s involvement in the events of 1965 he also stated that nadhatul ulama nu is like minus similarly is nu plus there have been too many similarities between the two such as the position and role of kyai the main contrast between them is that in nu the concept is visible in the form of accepted culture while in shia it takes the form of the nu is one of the largest independent ic organizations in the world some estimates of its membership range as high as 30 million although it is hard to account for this number nu acts as a charitable body helping to fill in many of the shortcomings of the n government in society it funds schools hospitals and organizes communities or into more coherent groups in order to help combat poverty history origins as a religious organization the nahdlatul ulama revival awakening of religious scholars was established in 1926 as an organization for orthodox muslims opposed to the modernist policies of the organization which rejected pre-ic nese traditions the organization was established by hasjim asjari the head of an ic religious school in east the organization expanded but the base of its support remained in east by 1928 the nu was using the nese language in its sermons alongside arabic in 1937 despite poor relations between the nu and muhammidayah the two organizations established the supreme ic council of n majlis a laa miai as a discussion forum they were joined by most of the other ic organizations in existence at the time in 1942 the japanese occupied and in september a conference of ic leaders was held in the japanese wanted to replace the miai but the conference not only decided to maintain the organization but also elected political figures belonging to the to the leadership rather than members of the non-political nu or as the occupiers had wanted just over a year later the miai was dissolved and replaced by the japanese-sponsored consultative council of n muslims hasjim asjari was the notional chairman but in practice the new organization was led by his son other nu and figures held leadership positions in 1945 and declared n independence during the n war of independence the nu declared that the fight against the dutch colonial forces was a holy war obligatory for all muslims among the guerrilla groups fighting for independence were hizbullah and sabillilah which were led by the nu the nu as a political party following the recognition of n independence a new party called was established with the nu as a component of it the nu leadership at the time had no political skills and was awarded few influential cabinet positions with the exception of chairman who was appointed religious affairs minister the nu was unhappy with its lack of influence within especially after a decision at the 1949 party conference changed the party s religious council on which the nu held several positions into a powerless advisory body two years later a dispute over the organization of the pilgrimage led to prime minister natsir s opposition to the reappointment of hasyim as religious affairs minister in the next cabinet in the ensuing cabinet crisis the nu made a series of demands including the retention of hasyim and threatened to leave on 5 april 1952 a few days after the announcement of a new cabinet without hasyim the nu decided in principle to leave three months later it withdrew all its members from councils and on 30 august it established the n league of muslims comprising the nu pssi and a number of smaller organizations it was chaired by hasyim during the era 1950 1957 nu members served in a number of cabinet posts in the the nu held three seats with zainul arifin appointed second deputy prime minister however following the fall of this cabinet some nu members were opposed to the nu joining the new cabinet to be formed by believing that if he was unable to form a cabinet the nu would be invited to try it was finally pressured into participating and was awarded the interior and religious affairs portfolios in the cabinet which was sworn in on 12 august 1955 on 29 september 1955 held its first the nu came in third with almost 7 million votes 18 4 of the total behind the n national party and it was awarded 45 seats in the up from only 8 before the election the nu was the largest party in its east base and 85 6 of its vote came from there was a clear division between representing outer-island urban voters and the nu representing the rural nese constituency three months later were held for the which was tasked with drawing up a permanent constitution the results were very similar with the nu winning 91 of the 114 seats in the 1950s the nu still wanted to see become an ic state and expressed its disapproval of a 1953 presidential speech in which rejected this three years later it also argued against s conception that would eventually lead to the establishment of as this would mean pki members sitting in the cabinet on 2 march 1957 the rebellion broke out among its demands was the restoration of mohammad to the vice-presidency the nu supported these calls meanwhile in the the nu joined the n ic union party the ic educators association perti and other parties to form the ic block which wanted n to become an ic state the block made up 44 8 of total seats however with none of the blocks able to command a majority and push through the constitution it wanted the assembly failed to agree and was dissolved by in a on 5 july 1959 that also restored the original which declared the state to be based on the philosophy not in 1960 president banned for alleged involvement in the rebellion however the fundamentalist and compradore leadership of nu saw the pro-poor communist party of which was close to as an obstacle to its ambitions and competed with it to win support from the poor five years later the coup attempt by the took place the n army blamed the pki and the nu youth wing ansor participated in the subsequent widespread following the deposing of the regime under president held in 1971 despite manipulation of the nu by the government which caused it to lose much credibility the nu managed to maintain its 18 share of the vote from the 1955 poll however in 1973 it was obliged to fuse into the new n partai persatuan pembangunan ppp the ppp came second after the government sponsored organization in the of and but in 1984 the new nu chairman also known as gus dur the son of wahid haschim withdrew the nu from the ppp because of dissatisfaction with the nu s lack of influence as a result in the the ppp vote collapsed from 28 in to only 16 from then on it was expected that the nu would concentrate on religious and social activities outside politics in 1984 the government announced that all organizations would have to accept state ideology as their basis once again the nu was accommodating with gus dur calling a noble compromise for muslims five years later gus dur was reelected for a second five-year term as chairman a position he held until being elected president in 1999 in 1990 the nu worked with bank summa to establish a system of rural banks did not approve of the nu straying beyond purely religious activities and the fact the bank was owned by a christian ethnic-chinese family led to controversy the bank was eventually shut down two years later because of financial mismanagement gus dur also incurred the disapproval of the regime by holding a mass rally at a stadium three months before the 1992 legislative ostensibly to express support for this resulted in gus dur being invited to meet lt col s son-in-law at military headquarters at the meeting gus dur was warned to avoid unacceptable political conduct and told that if he insisted in involving himself in politics rather than confining himself to religious matters he should express support for a further presidential term for in response gus dur threatened to leave the nu this resulted in the regime backing down as it could not risk bringing gus dur down the nu in the post era following the fall of and his replacement by vice-president in july 1998 gus dur announced the establishment of the n partai kebangkitan bangsa pkb on 10 november gus dur met with other pro-reform figures megawati putri and the so-called ciganjur four named after the location of gus dur s house issued a declaration calling the habibie administration transitional and calling for to be brought forward and for the n military to end its political role in s first free since 1955 held on 7 june 1999 the pkb won 13 percent of the vote in the ensuing session of the people s consultative assembly gus dur was elected president of defeating megawati by 373 votes to 313 however he was deposed just two years later the pkb subsequently split into two warring factions one led by gus dur s daughter yenny wahid an attempt in 2008 by gus dur to involve president susilo bambang yudhoyono in resolving the dispute failed and the pkb vote in the 2009 was half that of the previous vote in 2004 at its 2010 conference held in the nu decided not to discuss the split and passed a resolution banning officials from holding political posts seen as a commitment to avoiding future political involvement after the conference concerns about the longer term role of the nu continued to attract comment in the national media during 2011 for example there was continuing discussion about the national role that the nu should play and about the close political links between the nu and the pkb comments by gus dur s daughter yenny wahid for example reflected these concerns when she said that the nu was fragmenting and sliding into irrelevance aims the nu exists to spread ic teaching as well as preaching it undertakes educational activities through its network of 6 830 ic boarding schools or pesantren it also

digital camera this section requires june 2008 main article main article of the camera#s the first recorded attempt at building a digital camera was in 1975 by an engineer at eastman it used the then-new solid-state chips developed by in 1973 the camera weighed 8 pounds 3 6 kg recorded black and white images to a cassette tape had a of 0 01 10 000 and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in december 1975 the prototype camera was a technical exercise not intended for production the first true digital camera that recorded images as a ized file was likely the of 1988 which recorded to a 16 mb internal that used a battery to keep the data in memory this camera was never marketed in the united states and has not been confirmed to have shipped even in japan the first commercially available digital camera was the 1990 dycam model 1 it also sold as the fotoman it used a stored pictures digitally and connected directly to a for download the first flyby spacecraft image of mars was taken from mariner 4 on july 15 1965 with a camera system designed by nasa jpl it used a video camera followed by a digitizer rather than a mosaic of sensor elements so it was not what we usually define as a digital camera but it produced a digital image that was stored on tape for later slow transmission back to earth sensors and storage read the of light and store the digital image information as or as the two main types of sensors are in which the photocharge is shifted to a central charge-to-voltage converter and or nearly all use built-in and or removable solid state that double as a digital still cameras use discs and internal hard drives certain 20th century such as the range used and mini-cds multifunctionality and connectivity except for some type of cameras at the highest-end and simple at the lowest-end a device usually a and are less common is used for storing images which may be transferred to a later s can take pictures and may also record sound and video some can be used as some can use the standard to connect to a printer without using a and some can display pictures directly on a television set similarly many can take still photographs and store them on or on cards with the same functionality as performance metrics the quality of a digital image is a composite of various factors many of which are similar to those of film cameras count typically listed in millions of is only one of the major factors though it is the most heavily marketed manufacturers advertise this figure because consumers can use it to easily compare camera capabilities it is not however the major factor in evaluating a digital camera for most applications the processing system inside the camera that turns the into a color-balanced and pleasing photograph is usually more critical which is why some 4 megapixel cameras perform better than higher-end cameras image at left has a higher than the one to the right but lower resolution in is not the only measure of image quality a larger sensor with the same number of generally produces a better image than a smaller one one of the most important differences is an improvement in this is one of the advantages of digital cameras which have larger sensors than simpler cameras of the same quality see capture medium etc capture format digital file type 5x4 10x8 processing digital and or chemical processing of negative and print counts the number of n for a given maximum w horizontal by h vertical is the product n w h this yields e g 1 92 1 920 000 for an image of 1600 1200 the majority of compact as well as some have a 4 3 i e w h 4 3 according to review the 4 3 ratio is because monitors are 4 3 ratio old s always had a 4 3 ratio and thus inherited this the quoted by manufacturers can be misleading as it may not be the number of full-color for cameras using single-chip s the number claimed is the total number of single-color-sensitive photosensors whether they have different locations in the plane as with the or in stacks of three co-located photosensors as in the however the images have different numbers of rgb bayer-sensor cameras produce as many rgb as photosensors via interpolation while foveon sensors produce uninterpolated image files with one-third as many rgb as photosensors it is difficult to compare the s based on the megapixel ratings of these two types of sensors and therefore sometimes a subject of dispute the relative increase in detail resulting from an increase in is better compared by looking at the number of across or down the picture rather than the total number of in the picture area for example a sensor of 2560 1600 sensor elements is described as 4 2560 1600 4 096 000 increasing to 3200 2048 increases the in the picture to 6 553 600 6 5 a factor of 1 6 but the per cm in the picture at the same image size increases by only 1 25 times a measure of the comparative increase in linear is the square root of the increase in area i e in the entire image dynamic range practical imaging systems digital and film have a limited the range of that can be reproduced accurately of the subject that are too bright are rendered as white with no detail that are too dark are rendered as black the loss of detail is not abrupt with film or in dark with digital sensors some detail is retained as brightness moves out of the highlight burn-out of digital sensors however can be abrupt and highlight detail may be lost and as the sensor elements for different colors saturate in turn there can be gross hue or saturation shift in burnt-out highlights some can show these blown highlights in the image review allowing the photographer to re-shoot the picture with a modified exposure others compensate for the total contrast of a scene by selectively exposing darker longer a third technique is used by film in its digital the contains additional of lower sensitivity than the main ones these retain detail in parts of the image too bright for the main sensor high imaging hdr addresses this problem by increasing the of images by either increasing the of the or by using and post-processing the separate images to create a single image with a higher hdr images curtail burn-outs and black-outs further information storage many and most use s having to store image data the majority of cards for separate cameras are format many are and the other formats are rare format is the latest form of storage medium modern for a limited capacity for pictures that can be transferred to or from the card or through the camera s connections even without a inserted into the camera memory cards allow for vast numbers of photos to be taken requiring attention only when the has exhausted its free space for most users this translates into dozens to hundreds of quality photos to be stored on the same transferring the images is also possible for archival or personal use to another medium as required by the photographer applications and considerations with the acceptable image quality and the other advantages of digital particularly the time pressures of daily newspapers the majority of professional news capture their images with has also been adopted by many amateur who take advantage of the convenience of sending images by placing them on the or displaying them in the majority of cameras are integrated into but their usual small poor quality es and sensors render most of them unsuitable for making even moderate size prints some commercial and some amateurs interested in artistic have been resistant to using digital rather than film cameras because they believe that the image quality available from a digital camera is still inferior to that available from a film camera and the quality of images taken on film was thought to be impossible to match with a digital camera some have expressed a concern that changing technology may make inaccessible in the future a related concern in a specialized application is the use of with the added difficulty of demonstrating an image s authenticity some high-end film can also still be projected for viewing at a much higher optical than even the best digital projectors some professional resist the use of because they are poor performers when it comes to speed for multiple shots storing an 8mp image takes a lot of time and therefore in some applications are not currently other commercial and many amateurs have enthusiastically embraced digital because they believe that its flexibility and lower long-term costs outweigh its initial price disadvantages almost all of the cost of digital is capital cost meaning that the cost is for the equipment needed to store and copy the images and once purchased requires virtually no further expense outlay requires continuous expenditure of funds for supplies and developing although the equipment itself does not outdate so quickly and has a longer service life citation needed some commercial have also begun moving to digital technology because of the tremendous ing capabilities now offered on s the photographer is able to color-balance and otherwise manipulate the image in ways that traditional techniques cannot offer or are far more laborious in the with fully color-balanced systems from the camera to the monitor to the printer the photographer can now supply either as a print or as a display what is actually seen on the photographer s screen users can use a thus mixing the two technologies rapid advances in the technologies have resulted in many specialised being freely used in publications and internet discussions however require batteries that need to be recharged or replaced frequently and this means that a photographer needs access to electrical outlets s also tend to be much more sensitive to moisture and extreme cold for this reason who work in remote areas may favour film cameras though many higher-end s are now equipped with weather-resistant bodies medium and large-format film cameras are also still preferred by publications insisting on the very highest detail and was used in astro long before its use by the general public and had almost completely displaced photographic plates by the early 1980s s are more sensitive to light than plates and have a much more uniform and predictable response the s used in astronomy are similar to those used by the general public but are generally monochrome many of those used in are cooled with so as to reduce the caused by heat many astronomical instruments have arrays of many s sometimes totaling almost a billion amateur astronomers also commonly use including the use of for or video astronomy comparison with film main article versus film advantages and disadvantages of consumer the primary advantage of consumer-level versus film cameras is that eliminate the need to purchase hence potentially saving the digital camera owner money on film purchasing costs processing costs etc also the consumer avoids the need to return to the site of a photograph to re-shoot a poor exposure because the led display panel on the back of most immediately shows the image another advantage is almost every digital camera has a video mode and the most recent digital still cameras offer video mode with hd capability disadvantages of consumer-level versus higher-level include the fact that the sensor size format on most consumer-level is significantly smaller than the sensor size on the more expensive prosumer or professional-level which translates to lower image quality than is produced by a camera with a larger sensor size another significant disadvantage of many consumer-level as compared with prosumer and professional-level as well as the majority of film cameras is the long delay time between when the shutter release button is pushed and when the photograph is actually taken to many this is a major frustration and limitation since this problem makes the capturing of moving subjects largely impractical a disadvantage is the video modes have very poor focus in low-light situations many from 2007 to 2011 do not offer a low-light mode for their video function another disadvantage of the video modes of is the image-stability function does not operate while the subject is being filmed many digital still cameras have offered the image stability function solely as an ing tool during post-production after the video has been made whereas image stability is intended to compensate for camera shake in an ing function it distorts the image by cropping the image to counter-act the camera shake conversely the image stabilization offered on video cameras in 2012 functions while the video is being created eliminating the need for post-production s which harshly crop the image advantages of professional the retouched for painterly light effects immediate image review and deletion is possible lighting and composition can be assessed immediately which ultimately conserves storage space high volume of images to medium ratio allowing for extensive sessions without changing film rolls to most users a single is sufficient for the lifetime of the camera whereas film rolls are a re-incurring cost of film cameras faster workflow management colour and file manipulation and printing tools are more versatile than conventional film processes however batch processing of files can be time consuming even on a fast manipulation a digital image can be modified and manipulated much easier and faster than with traditional negative and print methods the digital image to the right was captured in format processed and output in 3 different ways from the source file then merged and further processed for color saturation and other special effects to produce a more dramatic result than was originally captured with the image recent manufacturers such as and have promoted the adoption of digital single reflex cameras s by images captured at 2 are deemed of sufficient quality for small images in newspaper or magazine reproduction eight to 24 megapixel images found in modern digital s when combined with high-end es can approximate the detail of film prints from based s not in citation given disadvantages of whereas film cameras can have manual backups for and electrical features are entirely dependent on an electrical supply usually batteries but sometimes power cord when in tethered mode many digital sensors have less than color print film however some newer s such as s which combines diodes of different sensitivity have improved upon this issue when highlights burn out they burn to white without details while film cameras retain a reduced level of detail as discussed high may manifest as multicolored speckles in digital images rather than the less-objectionable grain of high film while this speckling can be by noise-reduction software either in-camera or on a this can have a detrimental effect on image quality as fine detail may be lost in the process may add patterns to images that do not exist and would not appear in film for most consumers in prosperous countries such as the united states and western europe the advantages of outweigh their disadvantages however some professional still prefer film much of the post-shooting work done by a photo lab for film is done by the photographer himself for digital images concerns that have been raised by professional include ing and post-processing of files can take longer than 35mm film downloading a large number of images to a can be time-consuming shooting in remote sites requires the photographer to carry a number of batteries and add to the load to carry equipment failure while all cameras may fail some film camera problems e g meter or rangefinder problems failure of only some shutter speeds can be worked around as time passes it is expected that more professional will switch to digital in some cases where very high digital images of good quality are needed it may be advantageous to take large-format film photographs and digitise them this allows the creation of very large s without speed or capacity disadvantages at picture-taking time equivalent features image noise grain noise in a digital camera s image is remarkably similar to in a film camera at high levels film speed the grain noise becomes more apparent in the final image although film levels can be lower than digital levels 25 and 50 respectively digital settings can be changed quickly according to requirements while film must be physically replaced and protected from all light during such replacement additionally image techniques can be used to remove noise from digital images and is fixed from an artistic point of view and may be desirable when creating a specific mood for an image modern have comparable noise grain at the same as film cameras some though do exhibit a pattern in the that is not found on film speed of use previously had a longer start-up delay compared to film cameras i e the delay from when they are turned on until they are ready to take the first shot but this is no longer the case for modern with start-up times under 1 4 second 0 15 seconds for the d90 similarly the amount of time needed to write the data for a digital picture to the is now comparable to the amount of time it takes to wind the film on a film camera at least with modern and modern fast s citation needed both and film cameras have between when the shutter button is pressed and when the picture is taken this is the time necessary to autofocus the and compute and set the exposure this shutter delay is practically zero for and the best cameras frame rate the d3 can take still photographs at 11 frames per second the fastest film could shoot 14 frames per second f1-n with a super high speed motor but fewer than 100 were constructed for the 1984 summer olympics citation needed the f5 is limited to 36 continuous frames the length of the film while the eos-1d mark iii is able to take about 110 high definition images before its must be cleared and the remaining space on the can be used even such as film finepix hs10 has burst mode 10 frame s and lumix dmc-fz100 has 11 frame s moreover finepix hs10 can take movies at 1000 frame s at 224x64 with no sound image longevity and prints can fade but digital images can potentially last unchanged forever however the media on which the digital images are stored can decay or become corrupt leading to a loss of image integrity and digital media should be stored under archival conditions for maximum longevity without backup it is easier to lose huge amounts of digital data for example by accidental deletion of folders or by failure of a mass storage device in comparison each generation of copies of film negatives and transparencies is degraded compared to its parent images can easily be converted to digital by using a digital for example with some possible loss of quality colour reproduction colour reproduction is dependent on the type and quality of film or sensor used and the quality of the optical system and film processing different films and sensors have different color sensitivity the photographer needs to understand his equipment the light conditions and the media used to ensure accurate colour reproduction many offer format sensor data which makes it possible to choose color space in the development stage regardless of camera settings in effect the scene itself is stored as far as the sensor allows and can to some extent be rephotographed with different color balance exposure etc although format can be used the sensor and the camera s dynamics can only capture in the gamut that the system will allow and when that image is transferred for reproduction on any device the best possible that the person viewing the image will see is the of the end device for a monitor it would be the screen s for a photographic print it will be the of the device that printed the image on the paper gamut or space is an abstract term for describing an area where points of color fit in a three dimensional space you might more easily picture this as different shaped sized boxes whereby one box may not fit into another and therefore what does not fit gets clipped off a comparison of frame s a typical digital camera s is 1 33 4 3 the same as today s or tvs or earliest movies however a picture s is 1 5 3 2 several new take photos in either ratio and nearly all digital s take pictures in a 3 2 ratio as they usually use es designed for 35 mm film and digital s are notable exceptions some photo labs print photos on 4 3 ratio paper as well as the existing 3 2 in 2005 launched the first consumer camera with a native of 16 9 matching this is similar to a 7 4 which was a common size for aps film different s is one of the reasons consumers have cropping issues when printing digital photos or film photos moreover the majority of take an of 4 3 which translates to a size of 4 5 x 6 0 this translates into losing a half an inch when printing on the standard size of 4 x 6 an of 3 2 similar cropping occurs when printing on other sizes i e 5 x7 8 x10 or 11 x14 market impact in late 2002 2 megapixel cameras were available in the united states for less than 100 with some 1 megapixel cameras for under 60 at the same time many discount stores with photo labs introduced a digital front end allowing consumers to obtain true chemical prints as opposed to ink-jet prints in an hour these prices were similar to those of prints made from film negatives however because digital images have a different than 35 mm film images people have started to realize that 4x6 inch prints crop some of the image off the print some photofinishers have started offering prints with the same as the record in july 2003 entered the market with the release of the a 1 2 megapixel 1280 x 960 based digital camera costing only 11 u following the familiar single-use concept long in use with film cameras the dakota was intended to be used by a consumer one time only when the pre-programmed 25 picture limit is reached the camera is returned to the store and the consumer receives back prints and a cd-rom with their photos the camera is then refurbished and resold since the introduction of the dakota a number of similar single-use have appeared most of the various single-use are nearly identical to dakota regarding specifications and functionality although a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions such as higher image s and lcd screens most if not all of these single-use cost less than 20 u not including processing fees however the huge demand for complex at competitive prices has often resulted in manufacturing shortcuts evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions high parts prices and short service life some offer only a 90-day warranty prices of 35mm have dropped with manufacturers further to countries such as china announced in january 2004 that they would no longer sell branded film cameras in the in january 2006 followed suit and announced they would stop production of all but two models of their film cameras they will continue to produce the low-end fm10 and the high-end f6 in the same month konica minolta announced it was pulling out of the camera business altogether the price of 35mm and aps have dropped probably due to direct competition from digital and the resulting growth of the offer of second-hand film cameras pentax have reduced production of film cameras but not halted it the technology has improved so rapidly that one of s film cameras was discontinued before it was awarded a camera of the year award later in the year since 2002 have outsold film cameras however the use of 35mm cameras is greater in developing countries in guatemala for example extremely high import duties on all digital products serves to encourage sales and use of film cameras the decline in film camera sales has also led to a decline in purchases of film for such cameras in november 2004 a german division of photo split off within six months it filed for bankruptcy konica minolta photo imaging inc ended production of film and paper worldwide by march 31 2007 in addition by 2005 employed less than a third of the employees it had twenty years earlier it is not known if these job losses in the film industry have been offset in the digital image industry in addition digital has resulted in some positive market impacts as well the increasing popularity of products such as and is a direct result of the increasing popularity of digital an example of digital this photo was taken and made into a digital print in less than 5 minutes social impact this section may contain original re please by the claims made and adding statements consisting only of original re may be january 2009 s have decimated the film industry through declining use of film rolls and development chemicals previously required to develop the photos this led to a decrease in film and film camera sales and film processing and has had a dramatic effect on companies such as and in addition many stores that used to offer photofinishing services or sell film no longer do and those that do have seen a tremendous decline in 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry up until the advent of the digital camera amateur could either buy print film for their camera or slide film if they purchased slide film the resulting slides could be viewed using a slide projector revolutionized the industry by allowing for photographs to be viewed without conventional development processes and the significant time and costs associated with it the ease of viewing transferring and ing allowed consumers to manage their digital photos without use of specialized equipment s in however has arguably the largest impact on society smart phones have the ability to take and upload the taken images instantly to the interet in minutes allowing the photographer in certain situations even if the photographer is discovered and the images or recording are deleted pictures are not necessarily lost simon glik was arrested in 2007 for recording a police arrest on his cell phone but after filing a federal lawsuit he won the case and even prompted the obama administration to comment on the matter carlos miller a miami journalist recovered video of police officers arresting him after it was deleted from his camera throughout 2011 and 2012 images of syrian protests were

print which are tangible and immediately accessible to a person storage of digital images is ever-changing with old media and decoding software becoming obsoleted or inaccessible by new technologies historians are concerned that we are creating a historical void where information and details about an era will have been lost within either failed or inaccessible digital media it is recommended that both professional and amateur users develop strategies for migrating stored digital images from old technologies to new scrapbookers who may have used film for creating artistic and personal memoirs

coalfield from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from jump to the old mining sheave wheel now featured in the centre of in front of the museum map of the coalfields as as the coalfield in northern england is an area where was mined from the 15th century until 1973 it is part of a larger field which stretched into southern the stretched from in the north to the in the south and from in the east to in the west a total area of about 240 square miles 622 km2 most of the on the field were concentrated in the and valleys and around and the were grouped geographically with clusters of close together working the same seams often under the same ownership many shared the trackways and which connected them to the coal canal or railways for distribution the early were adits where outcropped or bell where was close to the surface these methods were abandoned when deep seams were mined the deepest shaft on the field was at the strap mine at which reached 1 838 feet 560 m flooding and dust explosions in some mines required improved ventilation and pumping engines several closed in the 19th century as the was worked out those that survived until 1947 became part of the but the expense of improving equipment and working conditions meant that these became uneconomical and the last pit closed in 1973 there is still evidence of the mine workings with the remains of buildings spoil heaps and in the area 3 basin 8 10 earl waldegrave s collieries 13 valley geology structure the coalfield consists of three informally referred to as basins the syncline in the north and the syncline in the south are separated by the east-west trending belt further to the west is the smaller syncline the syncline in particular is cut by a series of east-west and north-south trending stratigraphy the coal measures are divided into a lower middle and upper with seams found within each of these divisions lower and middle coal measures are found at depths between 500 and 5 000 feet 152-1 525 m together the lower and middle coal measures are 2 000 to 2 500 feet 610 762 m thick with the middle coal measures averaging about 1 600 feet 488 m and the lower coal measures about 600 feet 183 m only in the southern part of the syncline have s of the lower and middle coal measures been worked mainly at the newbury and collieries in the southeast and in the new rock and moorewood to the southwest only in the eastern part of syncline have s of the lower and middle coal measures been worked at the globe pit in the area in the 19th century the involved lateral compression of the rock sequence resulting in the tight folding fracturing and faulting of the and and the associated coal measures along the slide the distance between the broken ends of a seam can be as much as 1 500 feet 457 m the complex and thin seams gained the field notoriety and three underground explosions in 1893 1895 and 1908 were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne dust exploratory surveys of the local were carried out by who became known as the father of english building on work by smith worked for the stracheys who owned at one of their older mines the mearns pit at as he observed the rock at the pit he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern that the various could always be found in the same relative positions and each particular stratum could be identified by the it contained and the same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in other parts of england smith noticed an easterly dip in the beds of rock small near the surface about three then greater after the rocks which led to him a testable which he termed the and he began to determine if the relationships between the and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country during work as a surveyor appointed by for the coal canal company and subsequently he mapped the locations of rock and their vertical extent and drew cross-sections and tables of what he saw and earned the name strata smith coal seams the following seams are recognised within the field they are listed stratigraphically i e uppermost youngest first

believed that was mined in the area during times and there is documentary evidence of being dug on the mendips in 1305 and at in 1437 by the time of there were at and during the early 17th century was largely obtained by excavating the outcrops and driving which followed the seam into the ground only small amounts of could be obtained by these methods and bell were also dug these were vertical with a 4 feet 1 2 m diameter shaft up to 60 feet 18 3 m deep which were opened out at the bottom when all the that could safely be extracted from the pit had been recovered another pit was sunk close by to intersect the seam and the waste from the second pit thrown into the first at the beginning of the 19th century there were about 4000 people employed on the field the uses of were varied coal was used in to produce for used in building and by farmers to improve the soil from 1820 was used to produce for lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in the area was used to dry for the industry transport the field had a relatively low population density and did not have a major consuming industry nearby transporting to market was a key problem for the field s development in the pre era the roads serving the field were unsuited to moving bulley notes the problem was rendered far worse by the state of the roads in which were notorious down to the middle of the 18th century parishes in the area sometimes neglected or refused to repair those roads which were heavily used by carts thus in 1617 the inhabitants of stoke st michael complained that of late by reason of many mines the highways there are much in decay and grown very founderous in roads began in 1707 with the establishment of the trust but s did not reach the field until the mid 1700s the bristol trust which passed close to the western boundary of the field established in 1727 was of little importance as bristol was never a significant market having its own field turnpikes facilitated the movement of and enthused nothing so much contributes to the improvement of a county as good roads before the establishment of s many parts of the county were scarcely accessible was carried on horses backs to the distance of fifteen or twenty miles from the colliery each horse carried about two hundred and half weight now one horse with a light cart will draw four hundred weight or four times more than a horse could carry can an insignificant toll be put in competition with this saving map of the coal canal not all roads were improved and in 1819 skinner observed roads rendered bad by the passage of wagons expansion of production was limited by access to market such a need implied a canal project following lord middleton s dictum water transport is what all owners must aim at there were large gains from being connected to a canal system as stated by the coal commission at about this period 1800 the system of was being rapidly extended and the result was that s were gradually finding their way into districts that could not be reached unless at great cost by road a scheme for an extension of the was proposed in 1766 but canals did not reach the field for almost another 50 years in 1794 proprietors formed a committee to construct the coal canal with two branches into the and valleys and from a junction at to join the proposed at the near coal was transported by the coal canal and later by the bristol and north railway and and dorset joint railway which were accessed from the by a series of after 1854 when the first railway line was opened the tonnage carried by the canal declined rapidly decline and closure the total tonnage of produced by the field increased throughout the 19th century reaching a peak around 1901 when there were 79 separate collieries and production was 1 250 000 tons per annum the peak years for production were 1900 to 1920 however decline took hold and the number of reduced from 30 at the beginning of the 20th century to 14 by the mid-1930s 12 at when the was created on 1 january 1947 under the 5 in 1959 and none after 1973 despite some investment in new infrastructure particularly at norton hill thin seams made production expensive limiting profit and investment the conversion of from to oil and reduced national demand together with competition from more economical fields led to the closure of the last two and in september 1973 area today although there are still the remains of mines disused or redeveloped buildings and a few most have been removed or landscaped the area has returned to a largely rural nature between the and the in north east the towns and villages have some but are often for and bristol there is stone particularly in the mendips the colliers way national cycle route passes landmarks associated with the

on field tithe no 1428 but were no longer working by 1824 the old pit at which was also known as sutton top pit or upper sutton pit was dug before 1799 and owned by lieutenant henry fisher who sold it in 1821 to robert blinman dowling after dowling s death in 1852 the old pit was sold to mr t t hawkes but he defaulted on the payments and it was sold in 1853 to ancestor of and his associates the shaft reached a depth of 304 feet 93 m but the pit went out of production by 1855 when new pit which had been sunk in the early 19th century but then closed was reopened and deepened to exploit deeper seams new pit had two shafts of 4 feet 1 2 m diameter one for winding and one for pumping in 1896 it was owned by f spencer of new rock colliery and in 1908 by jesse lovell and sons by 1921 the pit employed 150 men and boys and produced 10 000 tins per annum the pit finally closed in 1929 colliery which opened in 1909 had the latest equipment at the time including cutters it had a red brick

of the properties of the structures that make up the it is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of and with and computational is distinct from psychological and theories of learning from disciplines such as and in that it emphasizes descriptions of functional and biologically realistic neurons and neural systems and their physiology and dynamics these models capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales from membrane currents protein and chemical coupling to columnar and topographic architecture and learning and memory these computational models are used to frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by current or future biological and or psychological experiments history the term computational was introduced by who organized a conference held in 1985 in carmel california at the request of the systems development foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names such as neural modeling theory and the proceedings of this definitional meeting were later published as the book computational 1990 the early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as and to name but a few lapicque introduced the model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907 this model is still one of the most popular models in computational for both cellular and studies as well as in mathematical because of its simplicity see the recent review article published recently for the centenary of the original lapicque s

collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena single-neuron modeling main article even single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and s only employed two voltage-sensitive currents the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and shunting scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents and the implications of the differing dynamics modulations and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational the computational functions of complex are also under intense investigation there is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons some models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts there are many software packages such as and that allow rapid and systematic in silico modeling of realistic neurons a project founded by from the aims to construct a biophysically

proper position in the central and peripheral systems how do form we know from molecular biology that distinct parts of the release distinct chemical cues from to that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent one hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the minimal wiring hypothesis which postulates that the formation of and effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage sensory processing early models of sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework is cred to somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another current re in sensory processing is divided among biophysical modelling of different subsystems and more theoretical modelling of perception current models of perception have suggested that the performs some form of and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world memory and synaptic plasticity main article earlier models of memory are primarily based on the postulates of biologically relevant models such as have been developed to address the properties of associative rather than content-addressable style of memory that occur in biological systems these attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium-term and long-term memory localizing in the models of working memory relying on theories of and persistent activity have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory one of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales unstable are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption stable forget less easily but they are also harder to consolidate one recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow to function at multiple time scales stereochemically detailed models of the based synapse with working at the time scale of microseconds have been built it is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades behaviors of networks biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex recurrent fashion these connections are unlike most artificial sparse and most likely specific it is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks it is also unknown what the computational functions if any of these specific connectivity patterns are the interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the the of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically there has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions schneidman et al 2006 shlens et al 2006 it s unknown however whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function with the emergence of and we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks in some cases the complex interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can be simplified using that gives rise to of while many neuro-theorists prefer such models with reduced complexity others argue that uncovering structure function relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible models of this type are typically built in large simulations platforms like or there have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity cognition discrimination and learning computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently begun experimental data comes primarily from in the and function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities there are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation the seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts for instance human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing faces one of the key goals of computational is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines the s large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields including biology and clinical practice integrative attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings these are the basis for some quantitative modeling of large-scale activity the computational representational understanding of mind is another attempt at modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired rule-based systems in decision making and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making consciousness one of the ultimate goals of is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life and made some attempts in formulating a consistent
